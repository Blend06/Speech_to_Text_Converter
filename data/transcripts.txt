on_006.wav	on the general principles of art mister quilter writes with equal lucidity

i_023.wav	i hope he doesn't work too hard said shaggy
he_024.wav	he doesn't work at all
in_025.wav	in fact there is nothing he can do in these dominions as well as our nomes whose numbers are so great that it worries us to keep them all busy

the_042.wav	the cut on his chest still dripping blood the ache of his overstrained eyes even the soaring arena around him with the thousands of spectators were trivialities not worth thinking about
his_043.wav	his instant of panic was followed by a small sharp blow high on his chest
one_044.wav	one minute a voice said and the time buzzer sounded
a_045.wav	a minute is not a very large measure of time and his body needed every fraction of it
the_046.wav	the buzzer's whirr triggered his muscles into complete relaxation
only_047.wav	only his heart and lungs worked on at a strong measured rate
he_048.wav	he was in reverie sliding along the borders of consciousness
the_049.wav	the contestants in the twenties needed undisturbed rest therefore nights in the dormitories were as quiet as death
particularly_050.wav	particularly so on this last night when only two of the little cubicles were occupied the thousands of others standing with dark empty doors
the_051.wav	the other voice snapped with a harsh urgency clearly used to command
im_052.wav	i'm here because the matter is of utmost importance and brandd is the one i must see now stand aside
the_053.wav	the twenties
he_054.wav	he must have drawn his gun because the intruder said quickly put that away you're being a fool out

i_075.wav	i happen to have mac connell's box for tonight or there'd be no chance of our getting places
alexander_076.wav	alexander exclaimed mildly
myself_077.wav	myself i always knew she had it in her
do_078.wav	do you know alexander mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger do you know i sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself
when_079.wav	when they entered the stage box on the left the first act was well under way the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of ireland
as_080.wav	as they sat down a burst of applause drew alexander's attention to the stage
of_081.wav	of course hilda is irish the burgoynes have been stage people for generations and she has the irish voice
its_082.wav	it's delightful to hear it in a london theatre
when_083.wav	when she began to dance by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night the house broke into a prolonged uproar
after_084.wav	after her dance she withdrew from the dialogue and retreated to the ditch wall back of philly's burrow where she sat singing the rising of the moon and making a wreath of primroses for her donkey
mac_085.wav	mac connell let me introduce mister bartley alexander
the_086.wav	the playwright gave mainhall a curious look out of his deep set faded eyes and made a wry face
he_087.wav	he nodded curtly and made for the door dodging acquaintances as he went
i_088.wav	i dare say it's quite true that there's never been any one else
hes_089.wav	he's another who's awfully keen about her let me introduce you
sir_090.wav	sir harry towne bowed and said that he had met mister alexander and his wife in tokyo
i_091.wav	i say sir harry the little girl's going famously to night isn't she
the_092.wav	the fact is she's feeling rather seedy poor child
a_093.wav	a little attack of nerves possibly
he_094.wav	he bowed as the warning bell rang and mainhall whispered you know lord westmere of course the stooped man with the long gray mustache talking to lady dowle
in_095.wav	in a moment peggy was on the stage again and alexander applauded vigorously with the rest
in_096.wav	in the half light he looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously recalling with amusement sir harry's judicial frown
he_097.wav	he leaned forward and beamed felicitations as warmly as mainhall himself when at the end of the play she came again and again before the curtain panting a little and flushed her eyes dancing and her eager nervous little mouth tremulous with excitement
all_098.wav	all the same he lifted his glass here's to you little hilda
im_099.wav	i'm glad she's held her own since
it_100.wav	it was youth and poverty and proximity and everything was young and kindly
the_101.wav	the last two days of the voyage bartley found almost intolerable
emerging_102.wav	emerging at euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon alexander had his luggage sent to the savoy and drove at once to bedford square
she_103.wav	she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
the_104.wav	the room was empty when he entered
a_105.wav	a coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit for it was already beginning to grow dark outside
she_106.wav	she called his name on the threshold but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it
she_107.wav	she merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder
i_108.wav	i never dreamed it would be you bartley
when_109.wav	when did you come bartley and how did it happen you haven't spoken a word
she_110.wav	she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult in leash
ill_111.wav	i'll do anything you wish me to bartley she said tremulously
he_112.wav	he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
hilda_113.wav	hilda watched him from her corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes
it_114.wav	it it hasn't always made you miserable has it
always_115.wav	always but it's worse now
its_116.wav	it's unbearable it tortures me every minute
i_117.wav	i am not a man who can live two lives he went on feverishly each life spoils the other
i_118.wav	i get nothing but misery out of either
there_119.wav	there is this deception between me and everything
at_120.wav	at that word deception spoken with such self contempt the color flashed back into hilda's face as suddenly as if she had been struck by a whiplash
she_121.wav	she bit her lip and looked down at her hands which were clasped tightly in front of her
could_122.wav	could you could you sit down and talk about it quietly bartley as if i were a friend and not some one who had to be defied
he_123.wav	he dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire
i_124.wav	i have thought about it until i am worn out
after_125.wav	after the very first
hildas_126.wav	hilda's face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
she_127.wav	she pressed his hand gently in gratitude weren't you happy then at all
something_128.wav	something of their troubling sweetness came back to alexander too
presently_129.wav	presently it stole back to his coat sleeve
yes_130.wav	yes hilda i know that he said simply
i_131.wav	i understand bartley i was wrong
she_132.wav	she listened intently but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair
you_133.wav	you want me to say it she whispered
bartley_134.wav	bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth
its_135.wav	it's got to be a clean break hilda
oh_136.wav	oh bartley what am i to do
you_137.wav	you ask me to stay away from you because you want me
i_138.wav	i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
hilda_139.wav	hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders
you_140.wav	you see loving some one as i love you makes the whole world different
and_141.wav	and then you came back not caring very much but it made no difference
she_142.wav	she slid to the floor beside him as if she were too tired to sit up any longer
dont_143.wav	don't cry don't cry he whispered
on_144.wav	on the last saturday in april the new york times published an account of the strike complications which were delaying alexander's new jersey bridge and stated that the engineer himself was in town and at his office on west tenth street
over_145.wav	over the fireplace there was a large old fashioned gilt mirror
he_146.wav	he rose and crossed the room quickly
of_147.wav	of course i know bartley she said at last that after this you won't owe me the least consideration but we sail on tuesday
i_148.wav	i saw that interview in the paper yesterday telling where you were and i thought i had to see you that's all good night i'm going now
let_149.wav	let me take off your coat and your boots they're oozing water
if_150.wav	if you'd sent me a note or telephoned me or anything
i_151.wav	i told myself that if i were really thinking of you and not of myself a letter would be better than nothing
he_152.wav	he paused they never did to me
oh_153.wav	oh bartley did you write to me
alexander_154.wav	alexander slipped his arm about her
i_155.wav	i think i have felt that you were coming
he_156.wav	he bent his face over her hair
and_157.wav	and i she whispered i felt that you were feeling that
but_158.wav	but when i came i thought i had been mistaken
ive_159.wav	i've been up in canada with my bridge and i arranged not to come to new york until after you had gone
then_160.wav	then when your manager added two more weeks i was already committed
im_161.wav	i'm going to do what you asked me to do when you were in london
only_162.wav	only i'll do it more completely
then_163.wav	then you don't know what you're talking about
yes_164.wav	yes i know very well
alexander_165.wav	alexander flushed angrily
i_166.wav	i don't know what i ought to say but i don't believe you'd be happy truly i don't aren't you trying to frighten me
a_167.wav	a laudable regard for the honor of the first proselyte has countenanced the belief the hope the wish that the ebionites or at least the nazarenes were distinguished only by their obstinate perseverance in the practice of the mosaic rites
their_168.wav	their churches have disappeared their books are obliterated their obscure freedom might allow a latitude of faith and the softness of their infant creed would be variously moulded by the zeal or prudence of three hundred years
yet_169.wav	yet the most charitable criticism must refuse these sectaries any knowledge of the pure and proper divinity of christ
his_170.wav	his progress from infancy to youth and manhood was marked by a regular increase in stature and wisdom and after a painful agony of mind and body he expired on the cross
he_171.wav	he lived and died for the service of mankind but the life and death of socrates had likewise been devoted to the cause of religion and justice and although the stoic or the hero may disdain the humble virtues of jesus the tears which he shed over his friend and country may be esteemed the purest evidence of his humanity
the_172.wav	the son of a virgin generated by the ineffable operation of the holy spirit was a creature without example or resemblance superior in every attribute of mind and body to the children of adam
nor_173.wav	nor could it seem strange or incredible that the first of these aeons the logos or word of god of the same substance with the father should descend upon earth to deliver the human race from vice and error and to conduct them in the paths of life and immortality
but_174.wav	but the prevailing doctrine of the eternity and inherent pravity of matter infected the primitive churches of the east
many_175.wav	many among the gentile proselytes refused to believe that a celestial spirit an undivided portion of the first essence had been personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh and in their zeal for the divinity they piously abjured the humanity of christ
he_176.wav	he first appeared on the banks of the jordan in the form of perfect manhood but it was a form only and not a substance a human figure created by the hand of omnipotence to imitate the faculties and actions of a man and to impose a perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies
but_177.wav	but the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of those of the docetes who taught not that christ was a phantom but that he was clothed with an impassible and incorruptible body
a_178.wav	a foetus that could increase from an invisible point to its full maturity a child that could attain the stature of perfect manhood without deriving any nourishment from the ordinary sources might continue to exist without repairing a daily waste by a daily supply of external matter
in_179.wav	in their eyes jesus of nazareth was a mere mortal the legitimate son of joseph and mary but he was the best and wisest of the human race selected as the worthy instrument to restore upon earth the worship of the true and supreme deity
when_180.wav	when the messiah was delivered into the hands of the jews the christ an immortal and impassible being forsook his earthly tabernacle flew back to the pleroma or world of spirits and left the solitary jesus to suffer to complain and to expire
but_181.wav	but the justice and generosity of such a desertion are strongly questionable and the fate of an innocent martyr at first impelled and at length abandoned by his divine companion might provoke the pity and indignation of the profane
their_182.wav	their murmurs were variously silenced by the sectaries who espoused and modified the double system of cerinthus
the_183.wav	the worthy friend of athanasius the worthy antagonist of julian he bravely wrestled with the arians and polytheists and though he affected the rigor of geometrical demonstration his commentaries revealed the literal and allegorical sense of the scriptures
yet_184.wav	yet as the profound doctor had been terrified at his own rashness apollinaris was heard to mutter some faint accents of excuse and explanation
he_185.wav	he acquiesced in the old distinction of the greek philosophers between the rational and sensitive soul of man that he might reserve the logos for intellectual functions and employ the subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life
but_186.wav	but instead of a temporary and occasional alliance they established and we still embrace the substantial indissoluble and everlasting union of a perfect god with a perfect man of the second person of the trinity with a reasonable soul and human flesh
under_187.wav	under the tuition of the abbot serapion he applied himself to ecclesiastical studies with such indefatigable ardor that in the course of one sleepless night he has perused the four gospels the catholic epistles and the epistle to the romans

without_189.wav	without any legal sentence without any royal mandate the patriarch at the dawn of day led a seditious multitude to the attack of the synagogues
such_190.wav	such crimes would have deserved the animadversion of the magistrate but in this promiscuous outrage the innocent were confounded with the guilty and alexandria was impoverished by the loss of a wealthy and industrious colony
the_191.wav	the zeal of cyril exposed him to the penalties of the julian law but in a feeble government and a superstitious age he was secure of impunity and even of praise
orestes_192.wav	orestes complained but his just complaints were too quickly forgotten by the ministers of theodosius and too deeply remembered by a priest who affected to pardon and continued to hate the praefect of egypt
a_193.wav	a rumor was spread among the christians that the daughter of theon was the only obstacle to the reconciliation of the praefect and the archbishop and that obstacle was speedily removed
which_194.wav	which oppressed the metropolitans of europe and asia invaded the provinces of antioch and alexandria and measured their diocese by the limits of the empire
exterminate_195.wav	exterminate with me the heretics and with you i will exterminate the persians
at_196.wav	at these blasphemous sounds the pillars of the sanctuary were shaken
but_197.wav	but the vatican received with open arms the messengers of egypt
the_198.wav	the vanity of celestine was flattered by the appeal and the partial version of a monk decided the faith of the pope who with his latin clergy was ignorant of the language the arts and the theology of the greeks
nestorius_199.wav	nestorius who depended on the near approach of his eastern friends persisted like his predecessor chrysostom to disclaim the jurisdiction and to disobey the summons of his enemies they hastened his trial and his accuser presided in the seat of judgment
sixty_200.wav	sixty eight bishops twenty two of metropolitan rank defended his cause by a modest and temperate protest they were excluded from the councils of their brethren
by_201.wav	by the vigilance of memnon the churches were shut against them and a strong garrison was thrown into the cathedral
during_202.wav	during a busy period of three months the emperor tried every method except the most effectual means of indifference and contempt to reconcile this theological quarrel
return_203.wav	return to your provinces and may your private virtues repair the mischief and scandal of your meeting
the_204.wav	the feeble son of arcadius was alternately swayed by his wife and sister by the eunuchs and women of the palace superstition and avarice were their ruling passions and the orthodox chiefs were assiduous in their endeavors to alarm the former and to gratify the latter
but_205.wav	but in this awful moment of the danger of the church their vow was superseded by a more sublime and indispensable duty
at_206.wav	at the same time every avenue of the throne was assaulted with gold
the_207.wav	the past he regretted he was discontented with the present and the future he had reason to dread the oriental bishops successively disengaged their cause from his unpopular name and each day decreased the number of the schismatics who revered nestorius as the confessor of the faith
a_208.wav	a wandering tribe of the blemmyes or nubians invaded his solitary prison in their retreat they dismissed a crowd of useless captives but no sooner had nestorius reached the banks of the nile than he would gladly have escaped from a roman and orthodox city to the milder servitude of the savages
he_209.wav	he had never been father lover husband friend
the_210.wav	the heart of that ex convict was full of virginity
his_211.wav	his sister and his sister's children had left him only a vague and far off memory which had finally almost completely vanished he had made every effort to find them and not having been able to find them he had forgotten them
he_212.wav	he suffered all the pangs of a mother and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing
only_213.wav	only as he was five and fifty and cosette eight years of age all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light
cosette_214.wav	cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become another being poor little thing
she_215.wav	she felt that which she had never felt before a sensation of expansion
the_216.wav	the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the hovel pretty
nature_217.wav	nature a difference of fifty years had set a profound gulf between jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf
to_218.wav	to meet was to find each other
when_219.wav	when these two souls perceived each other they recognized each other as necessary to each other and embraced each other closely
moreover_220.wav	moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well
he_221.wav	he had paid her six months in advance and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and dressing room as we have seen
week_222.wav	week followed week these two beings led a happy life in that hovel
cosette_223.wav	cosette was no longer in rags she was in mourning
and_224.wav	and then he talked of her mother and he made her pray
he_225.wav	he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll and in listening to her prattle
the_226.wav	the best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts
he_227.wav	he had returned to prison this time for having done right he had quaffed fresh bitterness disgust and lassitude were overpowering him even the memory of the bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant but after all that sacred memory was growing dim
who_228.wav	who knows whether jean valjean had not been on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more
alas_229.wav	alas he walked with no less indecision than cosette
he_230.wav	he protected her and she strengthened him
he_231.wav	he was that child's stay and she was his prop
forgotten_232.wav	forgotten too the name of gillian the lovely captive
worse_233.wav	worse and worse he is even presumed to be the captive's sweetheart who wheedles the flower the ring and the prison key out of the strict virgins for his own purposes and flies with her at last in his shallop across the sea to live with her happily ever after
but_234.wav	but this is a fallacy
the_235.wav	the wandering singer approaches them with his lute
the_236.wav	the emperor's daughter
lady_237.wav	lady lady my rose white lady but will you not hear a roundel lady
o_238.wav	o if you play us a roundel singer how can that harm the emperor's daughter
she_239.wav	she would not speak though we danced a week with her thoughts a thousand leagues over the water singer singer wandering singer o my honey sweet singer
but_240.wav	but if i play you a roundel lady get me a gift from the emperor's daughter her finger ring for my finger bring though she's pledged a thousand leagues over the water lady lady my fair lady o my rose white lady
the_241.wav	the wandering singer
but_242.wav	but i did once have the luck to hear and see the lady played in entirety the children had been granted leave to play just one more game before bed time and of course they chose the longest and played it without missing a syllable
the_243.wav	the ladies in yellow dresses stand again in a ring about the emperor's daughter and are for the last time accosted by the singer with his lute
the_244.wav	the wandering singer
ill_245.wav	i'll play for you now neath the apple bough and you shall dream on the lawn so shady lady lady my fair lady o my apple gold lady
the_246.wav	the ladies
now_247.wav	now you may play a serena singer a dream of night for an apple gold lady for the fruit is now on the apple bough and the moon is up and the lawn is shady singer singer wandering singer o my honey sweet singer
once_248.wav	once more the singer plays and the ladies dance but one by one they fall asleep to the drowsy music and then the singer steps into the ring and unlocks the tower and kisses the emperor's daughter
i_249.wav	i don't know what becomes of the ladies
bed_250.wav	bed time children
you_251.wav	you see the treatment is a trifle fanciful
how_252.wav	how we must simplify
it_253.wav	it seems to me more and more as i live longer that most poetry and most literature and particularly the literature of the past is discordant with the vastness and variety the reserves and resources and recuperations of life as we live it to day
it_254.wav	it is the expression of life under cruder and more rigid conditions than ours lived by people who loved and hated more naively aged sooner and died younger than we do
we_255.wav	we range wider last longer and escape more and more from intensity towards understanding
and_256.wav	and already this astounding blow begins to take its place among other events as a thing strange and terrible indeed but related to all the strangeness and mystery of life part of the universal mysteries of despair and futility and death that have troubled my consciousness since childhood
for_257.wav	for a time the death of mary obscured her life for me but now her living presence is more in my mind again
it_258.wav	it was that idea of waste that dominated my mind in a strange interview i had with justin
i_259.wav	i became grotesquely anxious to assure him that indeed she and i had been as they say innocent throughout our last day together
you_260.wav	you were wrong in all that i said she kept her faith with you
we_261.wav	we never planned to meet and when we met
if_262.wav	if we had been brother and sister indeed there was nothing
but_263.wav	but now it doesn't seem to matter very much
and_264.wav	and it is upon this effect of sweet and beautiful possibilities caught in the net of animal jealousies and thoughtless motives and ancient rigid institutions that i would end this writing

chapter_000.wav	chapter one missus rachel lynde is surprised missus rachel lynde lived just where the avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow fringed with alders and ladies eardrops and traversed by a brook
that_001.wav	that had its source away back in the woods of the old cuthbert place it was reputed to be an intricate headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods with dark secrets of pool and cascade but by the time it reached lynde's hollow it was a quiet well conducted little stream
for_002.wav	for not even a brook could run past missus rachel lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum it probably was conscious that missus rachel was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed from brooks and children up
and_003.wav	and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof there are plenty of people in avonlea and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own
but_004.wav	but missus rachel lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing circle
helped_005.wav	helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church aid society and foreign missions auxiliary yet with all this missus rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window knitting cotton warp quilts she had knitted sixteen of them
as_006.wav	as avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond
anybody_007.wav	anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of missus rachel's all seeing eye she was sitting there one afternoon in early june the sun was coming in at the window warm and bright
the_008.wav	the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky white bloom hummed over by a myriad of bees thomas lynde a meek little man whom avonlea people called rachel lynde's husband was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn
missus_009.wav	missus rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j blair's store over at carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon
peter_010.wav	peter had asked him of course for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life and yet here was matthew cuthbert at half past three on the afternoon of a busy day placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill
and_011.wav	and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of avonlea and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betokened that he was going a considerable distance now where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going there
had_012.wav	had it been any other man in avonlea missus rachel deftly putting this and that together might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him
he_013.wav	he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk matthew dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy was something that didn't happen often missus rachel ponder as she might could make nothing of it
and_014.wav	and her afternoon's enjoyment was spoiled i'll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where he's gone and why the worthy woman finally concluded he doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he never visits
if_015.wav	if he'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more
yet_016.wav	yet something must have happened since last night to start him off i'm clean puzzled that's what and i won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avonlea today accordingly after tea missus rachel set out she had not far to go
the_017.wav	the big rambling orchard embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lynde's hollow to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further matthew cuthbert's father as shy and silent as his son after him
had_018.wav	had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead green gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day
barely_019.wav	barely visible from the main road along which all the other avonlea houses were so sociably situated missus rachel lynde did not call living in such a place living at all it's just staying that's what she said as she stepped along the deep rutted grassy lane
bordered_020.wav	bordered with wild rose bushes it's no wonder matthew and marilla are both a little odd living away back here by themselves trees aren't much company though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them i'd ruther look at people to be sure
they_021.wav	they seem contented enough but then i suppose they're used to it a body can get used to anything even to being hanged as the irishman said with this missus rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables very green and neat and precise was that yard
set_022.wav	set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim lombardies not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen for missus rachel would have seen it if there had been privately she was of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house
one_023.wav	one could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt missus rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment
or_024.wav	or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor its windows looked east and west through the west one looking out on the back yard came a flood of mellow june sunlight but the east one
whence_025.wav	whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry trees in the left orchard and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook was greened over by a tangle of vines here sat marilla cuthbert when she sat at all always slightly distrustful of sunshine
and_026.wav	and here she sat now knitting and the table behind her was laid for supper missus rachel before she had fairly closed the door
there_027.wav	there were three plates laid so that marilla must be expecting some one home with matthew to tea but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab apple preserves and one kind of cake so that the expected company could not be any particular company
yet_028.wav	yet what of matthew's white collar and the sorrel mare missus rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet unmysterious green gables good evening rachel marilla said briskly this is a real fine evening isn't it won't you sit down
how_029.wav	how are all your folks something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between marilla cuthbert and missus rachel in spite of or perhaps because of their dissimilarity marilla was a tall
thin_030.wav	thin woman with angles and without curves her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it she looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience which she was
but_031.wav	but there was a saving something about her mouth which if it had been ever so slightly developed might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor we're all pretty well said missus rachel i was kind of afraid you weren't though when i saw matthew starting off today i thought maybe he was going to the doctor's
marillas_032.wav	marilla's lips twitched understandingly she had expected missus rachel up she had known that the sight of matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity oh no i'm quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said
matthew_033.wav	matthew went to bright river we're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia and he's coming on the train tonight if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia missus rachel could not have been more astonished
she_034.wav	she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds it was unsupposable that marilla was making fun of her but missus rachel was almost forced to suppose it are you in earnest marilla she demanded when voice returned to her yes of course
said_035.wav	said marilla as if getting boys from orphan asylums in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well regulated avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation missus rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt she thought in exclamation points
marilla_036.wav	marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum well the world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing
what_037.wav	what on earth put such a notion into your head she demanded disapprovingly this had been done without her advice being asked and must perforce be disapproved well we've been thinking about it for some time all winter in fact returned marilla
missus_038.wav	missus alexander spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopeton in the spring
so_039.wav	so matthew and i have talked it over off and on ever since we thought we'd get a boy matthew is getting up in years you know he's sixty and he isn't so spry as he once was his heart troubles him a good deal and you know how desperate hard it's got to be to get hired help
theres_040.wav	there's never anybody to be had but those stupid half grown little french boys and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the lobster canneries or the states at first matthew suggested getting a home boy but i said no flat to that
they_041.wav	they may be all right i'm not saying they're not but no london street arabs for me i said give me a native born at least there'll be a risk no matter who we get but i'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born canadian
so_042.wav	so in the end we decided to ask missus spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl we heard last week she was going so we sent her word by richard spencer's folks at carmody to bring us a smart likely boy of about ten or eleven we decided that would be the best age
old_043.wav	old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper we mean to give him a good home and schooling we had a telegram from missus alexander spencer today the mail man brought it from the station saying they were coming on the five thirty train tonight
so_044.wav	so matthew went to bright river to meet him missus spencer will drop him off there of course she goes on to white sands station herself missus rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind she proceeded to speak it now having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news
well_045.wav	well marilla i'll just tell you plain that i think you're doing a mighty foolish thing a risky thing that's what you don't know what you're getting you're bringing a strange child into your house and home and you don't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had
nor_046.wav	nor how he's likely to turn out why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night set it on purpose marilla and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds
and_047.wav	and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldn't break him of it if you had asked my advice in the matter which you didn't do marilla i'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing that's what
this_048.wav	this job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla she knitted steadily on i don't deny there's something in what you say rachel i've had some qualms myself but matthew was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in
its_049.wav	it's so seldom matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel it's my duty to give in and as for the risk there's risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world there's risks in people's having children of their own if it comes to that they don't always turn out well
and_050.wav	and then nova scotia is right close to the island it isn't as if we were getting him from england or the states he can't be much different from ourselves well i hope it will turn out all right said missus rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts
only_051.wav	only don't say i didn't warn you if he burns green gables down or puts strychnine in the well i heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies only it was a girl in that instance well we're not getting a girl said marilla
as_052.wav	as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy i'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up i wonder at missus alexander spencer for doing it but there she wouldn't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head
missus_053.wav	missus rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert bell's and tell the news it would certainly make a sensation second to none
and_054.wav	and missus rachel dearly loved to make a sensation so she took herself away somewhat to marilla's relief for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of missus rachel's pessimism well of all things that ever were or will be ejaculated missus rachel when she was safely out in the lane
it_055.wav	it does really seem as if i must be dreaming well i'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake matthew and marilla don't know anything about children and they'll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather
it_056.wav	it seems uncanny to think of a child at green gables somehow there's never been one there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were children which is hard to believe when one looks at them i wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything
my_057.wav	my but i pity him that's what so said missus rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart
chapter_058.wav	chapter two matthew cuthbert is surprised matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to bright river it was a pretty road running along between snug farmsteads with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through
or_059.wav	or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom the air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple while the little birds sang as if it were the one day of summer in all the year
matthew_060.wav	matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them for in prince edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not matthew dreaded all women except marilla and missus rachel
he_061.wav	he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him he may have been quite right in thinking so for he was an odd looking personage with an ungainly figure and long iron gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders
and_062.wav	and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty in fact he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty lacking a little of the grayness when he reached bright river there was no sign of any train
he_063.wav	he thought he was too early so he tied his horse in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station house the long platform was almost deserted the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end
matthew_064.wav	matthew barely noting that it was a girl sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody
and_065.wav	and since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then she sat and waited with all her might and main matthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper and asked him if the five thirty train would soon be along
the_066.wav	the five thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago answered that brisk official but there was a passenger dropped off for you a little girl she's sitting out there on the shingles i asked her to go into the ladies waiting room but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside
shes_067.wav	she's a case i should say i'm not expecting a girl said matthew blankly it's a boy i've come for he should be here missus alexander spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me the stationmaster whistled
guess_068.wav	guess there's some mistake he said missus spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently that's all i know about it and i haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts
i_069.wav	i don't understand said matthew helplessly wishing that marilla was at hand to cope with the situation well you'd better question the girl said the station master carelessly i dare say she'll be able to explain she's got a tongue of her own that's certain
maybe_070.wav	maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted he walked jauntily away being hungry and the unfortunate matthew was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den walk up to a girl a strange girl an orphan girl
and_071.wav	and demand of her why she wasn't a boy matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her she had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now matthew was not looking at her
a_072.wav	a child of about eleven garbed in a very short very tight very ugly dress of yellowish gray wincey she wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extending down her back were two braids of very thick decidedly red hair
her_073.wav	her face was small white and thin also much freckled her mouth was large and so were her eyes which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others so far the ordinary observer an extraordinary observer
might_074.wav	might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity that the mouth was sweet lipped and expressive that the forehead was broad and full in short our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded
was_075.wav	was so ludicrously afraid matthew however was spared the ordeal of speaking first for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby old fashioned carpet bag the other she held out to him
i_076.wav	i suppose you are mister matthew cuthbert of green gables she said in a peculiarly clear sweet voice i'm very glad to see you i was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me
i_077.wav	i had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to night
i_078.wav	i wouldn't be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry tree all white with bloom in the moonshine don't you think you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls couldn't you
matthew_079.wav	matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his then and there he decided what to do he could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake he would take her home and let marilla do that she couldn't be left at bright river anyhow
no_080.wav	no matter what mistake had been made so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at green gables i'm sorry i was late he said shyly come along the horse is over in the yard give me your bag oh i can carry it the child responded cheerfully
it_081.wav	it isn't heavy i've got all my worldly goods in it but it isn't heavy and if it isn't carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out so i'd better keep it because i know the exact knack of it it's an extremely old carpet bag oh i'm very glad you've come even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree
weve_082.wav	we've got to drive a long piece haven't we missus spencer said it was eight miles i'm glad because i love driving oh it seems so wonderful that i'm going to live with you and belong to you i've never belonged to anybody not really but the asylum was the worst i've only been in it four months but that was enough
its_083.wav	it's worse than anything you could imagine missus spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that
they_084.wav	they were good you know the asylum people but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum only just in the other orphans it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them
who_085.wav	who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess i used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that because i didn't have time in the day i guess that's why i'm so thin i am dreadful thin ain't i there isn't a pick on my bones
i_086.wav	i do love to imagine i'm nice and plump with dimples in my elbows with this matthew's companion stopped talking partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill
the_087.wav	the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks fringed with blooming wild cherry trees and slim white birches were several feet above their heads the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy
isnt_088.wav	isn't that beautiful what did that tree leaning out from the bank all white and lacy make you think of she asked well now i dunno said matthew why a bride of course a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil
ive_089.wav	i've never seen one but i can imagine what she would look like i don't ever expect to be a bride myself i'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me unless it might be a foreign missionary i suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular
but_090.wav	but i do hope that some day i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss i just love pretty clothes and i've never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember but of course it's all the more to look forward to isn't it and then
i_091.wav	i can imagine that i'm dressed gorgeously this morning when i left the asylum i felt so ashamed because i had to wear this horrid old wincey dress all the orphans had to wear them you know a merchant in hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum some people said it was because he couldn't sell it
but_092.wav	but i'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart wouldn't you when we got on the train i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me but i just went to work and imagined that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worth while
and_093.wav	and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes and a gold watch and kid gloves and boots i felt cheered up right away and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might i wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat neither was missus spencer although she generally is
she_094.wav	she said she hadn't time to get sick watching to see that i didn't fall overboard she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about but if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy i did prowl isn't it and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat because i didn't know whether i'd ever have another opportunity
oh_095.wav	oh there are a lot more cherry trees all in bloom this island is the bloomiest place i just love it already and i'm so glad i'm going to live here i've always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world
and_096.wav	and i used to imagine i was living here but i never really expected i would it's delightful when your imaginations come true isn't it but those red roads are so funny when we got into the train at charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past i asked missus spencer what made them red
and_097.wav	and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions she said i must have asked her a thousand already i suppose i had too but how you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions and what does make the roads red well now i dunno said matthew
thered_098.wav	there'd be no scope for imagination then would there but am i talking too much people are always telling me i do would you rather i didn't talk if you say so i'll stop i can stop when i make up my mind to it although it's difficult matthew
was_099.wav	was enjoying himself like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl women were bad enough in all conscience but little girls were worse
he_100.wav	he detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word that was the avonlea type of well bred little girl but this freckled witch was very different
and_101.wav	and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes
chapter_102.wav	chapter ninety nine the law we have seen how quietly

not_109.wav	not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it

was_111.wav	was ascending the stairs leading to debray's apartments
debray_112.wav	debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him
still_113.wav	still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugenie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart tea play
and_114.wav	and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs
awaited_115.wav	awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed
with_116.wav	with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman at twenty minutes of twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect they seldom return home after twelve o'clock
the_117.wav	the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugenie used in leaving it she ran lightly up stairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of eugenie she was fearful of exciting any remark
and_118.wav	and believed firmly in her daughter's innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof she listened at eugenie's door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening
and_119.wav	and had gone to bed and to sleep she called the maid and questioned her mademoiselle eugenie said the maid
after_120.wav	after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer
madame_121.wav	madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult
who_122.wav	who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son eugenie she said to herself is lost and so are we the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame
for_123.wav	for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound
and_124.wav	and her glance was turned towards heaven
and_125.wav	and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin
and_126.wav	and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one
supported_127.wav	supported by an honorable name how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays her
debray_128.wav	debray could but give her advice she must apply to some one more powerful than he
but_129.wav	but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption
it_130.wav	it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way
no_131.wav	no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andrea's intrigues
appeared_132.wav	appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least
obtain_133.wav	obtain all the indulgence he could allow she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days
he_134.wav	he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court and after this reasoning she slept easily
at_135.wav	at nine o'clock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night then running down stairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence
for_136.wav	for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague some of the apartments were closed within and without the shutters were only opened to admit a minute's air showing the scared face of a footman
and_137.wav	and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice
madame_138.wav	madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion
three_139.wav	three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard
he_140.wav	he saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady
first_141.wav	first madame who are you who am i you know me well enough we no longer know any one madame
where_142.wav	where do you come from oh this is too much madame these are my orders excuse me your name the baroness danglars you have seen me twenty times
possibly_143.wav	possibly madame and now what do you want
madame_144.wav	madame this is precaution not impertinence
or_145.wav	or without speaking to the procureur well i have business with the procureur is it pressing business you can imagine so since i have not even brought my carriage out yet but enough of this here is my card
take_146.wav	take it to your master madame will await my return yes go the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street she had not long to wait
directly_147.wav	directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it
you_148.wav	you will excuse this poor fellow madame
in_149.wav	in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions the baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own
preoccupied_150.wav	preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it
raising_151.wav	raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips forgive my servants he said for a terror i cannot blame them for from being suspected they have become suspicious
you_152.wav	you too then are unhappy she said yes madame replied the magistrate then you pity me sincerely madame and you understand what brings me here
you_153.wav	you wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened yes sir a fearful misfortune you mean a mischance a mischance repeated the baroness alas madame
said_154.wav	said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable and do you suppose this will be forgotten everything will be forgotten madame said villefort
your_155.wav	your daughter will be married to morrow if not to day in a week if not to morrow and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm
am_156.wav	am i come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity
said_157.wav	said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him well then be more affectionate my dear villefort
said_158.wav	said the baroness speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay villefort bowed when i hear misfortunes named madame
he_159.wav	he said i have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then i cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes
but_160.wav	but this annoys you let us change the subject you were saying madame i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor impostor
certainly_161.wav	certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others impostor indeed
is_162.wav	is nothing more nor less than an assassin sir i do not deny the justice of your correction
come_163.wav	come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him go you are too late madame the orders are issued
i_164.wav	i hope so if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisoners afford means of escape will you leave him in prison the procureur shook his head at least keep him there till my daughter be married
impossible_165.wav	impossible madame justice has its formalities what even for me said the baroness half jesting half in earnest for all even for myself among the rest
replied_166.wav	replied villefort ah exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart
you_167.wav	you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months
have_168.wav	have not happened by natural means i was not thinking of that replied madame danglars quickly yes you were thinking of it and with justice
you_169.wav	you who pursue crime so vindictively answer now
the_170.wav	the baroness became pale you were saying this were you not well i own it i will answer you
then_171.wav	then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown
villefort_172.wav	villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred
now_173.wav	now after the oath i have just taken and which i will keep madame dare you ask for mercy for that wretch but sir are you sure he is as guilty as they say listen
this_174.wav	this is his description benedetto condemned at the age of sixteen for five years to the galleys for forgery he promised well as you see first a runaway then an assassin
and_175.wav	and who is this wretch who can tell a vagabond a corsican has no one owned him no one his parents are unknown
but_176.wav	but who was the man who brought him from lucca another rascal like himself perhaps his accomplice the baroness clasped her hands
for_177.wav	for heaven's sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshness for heaven's sake
what_178.wav	what am i the law has the law any eyes to witness your grief
has_179.wav	has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall no madame
and_180.wav	and when it commands it strikes you will tell me that i am a living being and not a code a man and not a volume look at me madame
have_181.wav	have mankind treated me as a brother have they loved me have they spared me has any one shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands no madame they struck me always struck me
woman_182.wav	woman siren that you are
well_183.wav	well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those but having sinned myself it may be more deeply than others
i_184.wav	i never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their weaknesses i have always found them and more i repeat it with joy with triumph i have always found some proof of human perversity or error
every_185.wav	every criminal i condemn seems to me living evidence that i am not a hideous exception to the rest alas alas alas all the world is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness
with_186.wav	with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words
this_187.wav	this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody so much the worse or rather so much the better
but_188.wav	but this is trampling on the weak sir the weakness of a murderer his dishonor reflects upon us
oh_189.wav	oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you be it so said villefort raising his arms to heaven at least
delay_190.wav	delay the trial till the next assizes
no_191.wav	no madame said villefort instructions have been given
five_192.wav	five days are more than i require
i_193.wav	i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel still it is better than suffering but sir he has fled let him escape inaction is a pardonable offence
i_194.wav	i tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute
a_195.wav	a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior
madame_196.wav	madame danglars trembled with fear villefort started with joy arrested he exclaimed he was taken at compiegne and all is over
pale_197.wav	pale and cold adieu sir she said adieu madame replied the king's attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door
chapter_198.wav	chapter seventeen when wendy grew up i hope you want to know what became of the other boys they were waiting below to give wendy time to explain about them and when they had counted five hundred they went up
they_199.wav	they went up by the stair because they thought this would make a better impression they stood in a row in front of missus darling with their hats off and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes they said nothing but their eyes asked her to have them
but_200.wav	but they forgot about him of course missus darling said at once that she would have them but mister darling was curiously depressed and they saw that he considered six a rather large number i must say he said to wendy
that_201.wav	that you don't do things by halves a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them the first twin was the proud one and he asked flushing do you think we should be too much of a handful sir because if so we can go away
father_202.wav	father wendy cried shocked but still the cloud was on him he knew he was behaving unworthily but he could not help it we could lie doubled up said nibs i always cut their hair myself said wendy
george_203.wav	george missus darling exclaimed pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light then he burst into tears and the truth came out he was as glad to have them as she was he said
but_204.wav	but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers
i_205.wav	i don't think he is a cypher tootles cried instantly do you think he is a cypher curly no i don't do you think he is a cypher slightly rather not twin what do you think
it_206.wav	it turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher and he was absurdly gratified and said he would find space for them all in the drawing room if they fitted in we'll fit in sir they assured him then follow the leader he cried gaily
mind_207.wav	mind you i am not sure that we have a drawing room but we pretend we have and it's all the same hoop la he went off dancing through the house and they all cried hoop la and danced after him searching for the drawing room and i forget whether they found it
but_208.wav	but at any rate they found corners and they all fitted in as for peter he saw wendy once again before he flew away he did not exactly come to the window but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him
that_209.wav	that is what she did hullo wendy good bye he said oh dear are you going away yes you don't feel peter she said falteringly
that_210.wav	that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject no about me peter no missus darling came to the window
would_211.wav	would you send me to school he inquired craftily yes and then to an office i suppose so
very_212.wav	very soon i don't want to go to school and learn solemn things he told her passionately i don't want to be a man o wendy's mother if i was to wake up and feel there was a beard peter said wendy the comforter i should love you in a beard
and_213.wav	and missus darling stretched out her arms to him but he repulsed her keep back lady
but_214.wav	but where are you going to live with tink in the house we built for wendy the fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights how lovely cried wendy so longingly that missus darling tightened her grip i thought all the fairies were dead missus darling said
because_215.wav	because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies they live in nests on the tops of trees and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are
i_216.wav	i shall have tink tink can't go a twentieth part of the way round she reminded him a little tartly
tink_217.wav	tink called out from somewhere round the corner it doesn't matter peter said o peter you know it matters
may_218.wav	may i mummy certainly not i have got you home again and i mean to keep you but he does so need a mother so do you my love oh all right peter said as if he had asked her from politeness merely
long_219.wav	long in coming but this promise sent peter away quite gay again
i_220.wav	i suppose it was because wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones you won't forget me peter will you before spring cleaning time comes of course peter promised and then he flew away he took missus darling's kiss with him
the_221.wav	the kiss that had been for no one else peter took quite easily funny but she seemed satisfied of course all the boys went to school
but_222.wav	but it was too late now and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or jenkins minor
in_223.wav	in time they could not even fly after their hats want of practice they called it but what it really meant was that they no longer believed michael believed longer than the other boys
though_224.wav	though they jeered at him so he was with wendy when peter came for her at the end of the first year she flew away with peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the neverland and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become but he never noticed he had so much to say about himself
she_225.wav	she had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times but new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind who is captain hook
when_226.wav	when she spoke of the arch enemy don't you remember she asked amazed how you killed him and saved all our lives i forget them after i kill them he replied carelessly when she expressed a doubtful hope that tinker bell would be glad to see her he said
who_227.wav	who is tinker bell o peter she said shocked but even when she explained he could not remember there are such a lot of them he said i expect she is no more i expect he was right for fairies don't live long
but_228.wav	but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to peter
but_229.wav	but he was exactly as fascinating as ever and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops next year he did not come for her she waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet but he never came
perhaps_230.wav	perhaps he is ill michael said you know he is never ill michael came close to her and whispered with a shiver perhaps there is no such person wendy and then wendy would have cried if michael had not been crying
peter_231.wav	peter came next spring cleaning and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year that was the last time the girl wendy ever saw him for a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains
and_232.wav	and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge but the years came and went without bringing the careless boy and when they met again wendy was a married woman and peter was no more to her
than_233.wav	than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys wendy was grown up you need not be sorry for her she was one of the kind that likes to grow up in the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls
all_234.wav	all the boys were grown up and done for by this time so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them you may see the twins and nibs and curly any day going to an office each carrying a little bag and an umbrella
you_235.wav	you see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door that used to be tootles the bearded man who doesn't know any story to tell his children
and_236.wav	and always had an odd inquiring look
when_237.wav	when she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about peter pan she loved to hear of peter and wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place
who_238.wav	who was no longer fond of stairs missus darling was now dead and forgotten there were only two beds in the nursery now jane's and her nurse's and there was no kennel for nana also had passed away
she_239.wav	she died of old age and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself once a week jane's nurse had her evening off
and_240.wav	and then it was wendy's part to put jane to bed that was the time for stories it was jane's invention to raise the sheet over her mother's head and her own thus making a tent
i_241.wav	i don't think i see anything to night says wendy with a feeling that if nana were here she would object to further conversation yes you do says jane
that_242.wav	that is a long time ago sweetheart says wendy ah me how time flies does it fly asks the artful child the way you flew when you were a little girl
why_243.wav	why can't you fly now mother because i am grown up dearest when people grow up they forget the way why do they forget the way because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless
it_244.wav	it is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly what is gay and innocent and heartless
or_245.wav	or perhaps wendy admits she does see something i do believe she says that it is this nursery i do believe it is says jane go on
they_246.wav	they are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when peter flew in looking for his shadow
you_247.wav	you have missed a bit interrupts jane who now knows the story better than her mother when you saw him sitting on the floor crying what did you say i sat up in bed and i said boy why are you crying
yes_248.wav	yes that was it says jane with a big breath and then he flew us all away to the neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid's lagoon
yes_249.wav	yes which did you like best of all i think i liked the home under the ground best of all
what_250.wav	what was the last thing peter ever said to you the last thing he ever said to me was just always be waiting for me and then some night you will hear me crowing yes but alas he forgot all about me
wendy_251.wav	wendy said it with a smile she was as grown up as that what did his crow sound like jane asked one evening it was like this wendy said
trying_252.wav	trying to imitate peter's crow no it wasn't jane said gravely
jane_253.wav	jane said ah yes many girls hear it when they are sleeping but i was the only one who heard it awake lucky you said jane and then one night came the tragedy it was the spring of the year
wendy_254.wav	wendy was sitting on the floor very close to the fire so as to see to darn for there was no other light in the nursery and while she sat darning she heard a crow then the window blew open as of old
he_255.wav	he was exactly the same as ever and wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth he was a little boy and she was grown up she huddled by the fire not daring to move helpless and guilty
a_256.wav	a big woman hullo wendy he said not noticing any difference for he was thinking chiefly of himself and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first hullo peter
she_257.wav	she replied faintly squeezing herself as small as possible something inside her was crying woman woman let go of me hullo where is john he asked suddenly missing the third bed
john_258.wav	john is not here now she gasped is michael asleep he asked with a careless glance at jane
that_259.wav	that is not michael she said quickly lest a judgment should fall on her peter looked hullo is it a new one yes boy or girl girl now surely he would understand but not a bit of it
peter_260.wav	peter she said faltering are you expecting me to fly away with you of course that is why i have come he added a little sternly have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time
she_261.wav	she knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass i can't come she said apologetically i have forgotten how to fly i'll soon teach you again o peter don't waste the fairy dust on me
what_262.wav	what is it he cried shrinking
for_263.wav	for almost the only time in his life that i know of peter was afraid don't turn up the light he cried she let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy she was not a little girl heart broken about him
she_264.wav	she was a grown woman smiling at it all
then_265.wav	then she turned up the light and peter saw he gave a cry of pain and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply what is it he cried again she had to tell him
i_266.wav	i am old peter i am ever so much more than twenty i grew up long ago you promised not to i couldn't help it
no_267.wav	no you're not yes and the little girl in the bed is my baby no she's not
of_268.wav	of course he did not strike
and_269.wav	and wendy did not know how to comfort him though she could have done it so easily once she was only a woman now and she ran out of the room to try to think peter continued to cry and soon his sobs woke jane
boy_270.wav	boy she said why are you crying peter rose and bowed to her and she bowed to him from the bed hullo he said hullo said jane my name is peter pan he told her
yes_271.wav	yes i know i came back for my mother he explained to take her to the neverland yes i know jane said i have been waiting for you when wendy returned diffidently she found peter sitting on the bed post crowing gloriously
while_272.wav	while jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy she is my mother peter explained and jane descended and stood by his side with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him
he_273.wav	he does so need a mother jane said yes i know wendy admitted rather forlornly no one knows it so well as i good bye said peter to wendy and he rose in the air and the shameless jane rose with him
it_274.wav	it was already her easiest way of moving about wendy rushed to the window no no she cried it is just for spring cleaning time jane said he wants me always to do his spring cleaning
if_275.wav	if only i could go with you wendy sighed you see you can't fly said jane of course in the end wendy let them fly away together
our_276.wav	our last glimpse of her shows her at the window
as_277.wav	as you look at wendy you may see her hair becoming white and her figure little again for all this happened long ago
and_278.wav	and every spring cleaning time except when he forgets peter comes for margaret and takes her to the neverland where she tells him stories about himself to which he listens eagerly when margaret grows up she will have a daughter who is to be peter's mother in turn
he_279.wav	he took a resolve after this not to misinterpret her words even when miss stackpole appeared to strike the personal note most strongly he bethought himself that persons in her view were simple and homogeneous organisms
to_280.wav	to deal with her in strict reciprocity he carried out his resolve with a great deal of tact and the young lady found in renewed contact with him no obstacle to the exercise of her genius for unshrinking enquiry
the_281.wav	the general application of her confidence her situation at gardencourt therefore appreciated as we have seen her to be by isabel and full of appreciation herself of that free play of intelligence
she_282.wav	she presently discovered in truth that this obligation was of the lightest and that missus touchett cared very little how miss stackpole behaved missus touchett had defined her to isabel
as_283.wav	as both an adventuress and a bore adventuresses usually giving one more of a thrill she had expressed some surprise at her niece's having selected such a friend
yet_284.wav	yet had immediately added that she knew isabel's friends were her own affair and that she had never undertaken to like them all or to restrict the girl to those she liked
my_285.wav	my dear you'd have a very small society missus touchett frankly admitted and i don't think i like any man or woman well enough to recommend them to you when it comes to recommending it's a serious affair
i_286.wav	i don't like miss stackpole everything about her displeases me she talks so much too loud and looks at one as if one wanted to look at her which one doesn't
im_287.wav	i'm sure she has lived all her life in a boarding house and i detest the manners and the liberties of such places if you ask me if i prefer my own manners which you doubtless think very bad i'll tell you that i prefer them immensely
and_288.wav	and she detests me for detesting it
missus_289.wav	missus touchett was right in guessing that henrietta disapproved of her but she had not quite put her finger on the reason a day or two after miss stackpole's arrival
which_290.wav	which excited a vein of counter argument on the part of the correspondent of the interviewer who in the exercise of her profession had acquainted herself in the western world with every form of caravansary
ralph_291.wav	ralph with his experimental geniality suggested by way of healing the breach that the truth lay between the two extremes and that the establishments in question ought to be described as fair middling
this_292.wav	this contribution to the discussion however miss stackpole rejected with scorn middling indeed if they were not the best in the world they were the worst but there was nothing middling about an american hotel
i_293.wav	i like to be treated as an american lady poor american ladies cried missus touchett with a laugh they're the slaves of slaves they're the companions of freemen henrietta retorted
theyre_294.wav	they're the companions of their servants the irish chambermaid and the negro waiter they share their work do you call the domestics in an american household slaves miss stackpole enquired
if_295.wav	if that's the way you desire to treat them no wonder you don't like america if you've not good servants you're miserable missus touchett serenely said they're very bad in america but i've five perfect ones in florence
i_296.wav	i don't see what you want with five henrietta couldn't help observing i don't think i should like to see five persons surrounding me in that menial position
should_297.wav	should you like me better if i were your butler dear her husband asked i don't think i should you wouldn't at all have the tenue the companions of freemen i like that miss stackpole said ralph
its_298.wav	it's a beautiful description when i said freemen i didn't mean you sir and this was the only reward that ralph got for his compliment miss stackpole was baffled
which_299.wav	which she privately judged to be a mysterious survival of feudalism it was perhaps because her mind was oppressed with this image that she suffered some days to elapse before she took occasion to say to isabel
my_300.wav	my dear friend i wonder if you're growing faithless faithless faithless to you henrietta no that would be a great pain but it's not that faithless to my country then
that_301.wav	that i hope will never be when i wrote to you from liverpool i said i had something particular to tell you you've never asked me what it is is it because you've suspected suspected what
you_302.wav	you don't ask that right as if you thought it important you're changed you're thinking of other things tell me what you mean and i'll think of that will you really think of it that's what i wish to be sure of
ive_303.wav	i've not much control of my thoughts but i'll do my best said isabel henrietta gazed at her in silence for a period which tried isabel's patience so that our heroine added at last
isabel_304.wav	isabel responded you say that right i had a good deal of talk with him he has come after you did he tell you so no he told me nothing that's how i knew it said henrietta cleverly
he_305.wav	he said very little about you but i spoke of you a good deal isabel waited at the mention of mister goodwood's name she had turned a little pale i'm very sorry you did that she observed at last
i_306.wav	i could have talked a long time to such a listener he was so quiet so intense he drank it all in what did you say about me isabel asked i said you were on the whole the finest creature i know
while_307.wav	while i talked i never saw an ugly man look so handsome he's very simple minded said isabel and he's not so ugly there's nothing so simplifying as a grand passion
its_308.wav	it's not a grand passion i'm very sure it's not that you don't say that as if you were sure isabel gave rather a cold smile i shall say it better to mister goodwood himself
isabel_309.wav	isabel offered no answer to this assertion which her companion made with an air of great confidence he'll find you changed the latter pursued you've been affected by your new surroundings very likely i'm affected by everything
by_310.wav	by everything but mister goodwood miss stackpole exclaimed with a slightly harsh hilarity isabel failed even to smile back and in a moment she said did he ask you to speak to me not in so many words
but_311.wav	but his eyes asked it and his handshake when he bade me good bye thank you for doing so and isabel turned away yes you're changed you've got new ideas over here her friend continued i hope so said isabel
one_312.wav	one should get as many new ideas as possible yes but they shouldn't interfere with the old ones when the old ones have been the right ones isabel turned about again if you mean that i had any idea with regard to mister goodwood
but_313.wav	but she faltered before her friend's implacable glitter my dear child you certainly encouraged him isabel made for the moment as if to deny this charge instead of which however she presently answered
its_314.wav	it's very true i did encourage him and then she asked if her companion had learned from mister goodwood what he intended to do it was a concession to her curiosity for she disliked discussing the subject
and_315.wav	and found henrietta wanting in delicacy i asked him and he said he meant to do nothing miss stackpole answered but i don't believe that he's not a man to do nothing he is a man of high bold action
and_316.wav	and whatever he does will always be right i quite believe that henrietta might be wanting in delicacy but it touched the girl all the same to hear this declaration ah you do care for him her visitor rang out
whatever_317.wav	whatever he does will always be right isabel repeated when a man's of that infallible mould what does it matter to him what one feels it may not matter to him but it matters to one's self ah
i_318.wav	i hope he'll hate me then said isabel i believe you hope it about as much as i believe him capable of it to this observation our heroine made no return
she_319.wav	she was absorbed in the alarm given her by henrietta's intimation that caspar goodwood would present himself at gardencourt she pretended to herself however that she thought the event impossible and later
she_320.wav	she communicated her disbelief to her friend for the next forty eight hours nevertheless she stood prepared to hear the young man's name announced the feeling pressed upon her it made the air sultry
and_321.wav	and after strolling about for some time in a manner at once listless and restless had seated herself on a garden bench within sight of the house beneath a spreading beech where in a white dress ornamented with black ribbons
she_322.wav	she formed among the flickering shadows a graceful and harmonious image
as_323.wav	as to whom the proposal of an ownership divided with her cousin had been applied as impartially as possible as impartially as bunchie's own somewhat fickle and inconstant sympathies would allow
but_324.wav	but she was notified for the first time on this occasion of the finite character of bunchie's intellect hitherto she had been mainly struck with its extent
it_325.wav	it seemed to her at last that she would do well to take a book formerly when heavy hearted she had been able with the help of some well chosen volume to transfer the seat of consciousness to the organ of pure reason
of_326.wav	of late it was not to be denied literature had seemed a fading light and even after she had reminded herself that her uncle's library was provided with a complete set of those authors which no gentleman's collection should be without
she_327.wav	she sat motionless and empty handed her eyes bent on the cool green turf of the lawn her meditations were presently interrupted by the arrival of a servant who handed her a letter the letter bore the london postmark
you_328.wav	you will remember that when you gave me my dismissal at albany three months ago i did not accept it i protested against it you in fact appeared to accept my protest and to admit that i had the right on my side
i_329.wav	i had come to see you with the hope that you would let me bring you over to my conviction my reasons for entertaining this hope had been of the best but you disappointed it i found you changed
arbitrary_330.wav	arbitrary or capricious therefore it is that i believe you will let me see you again you told me that i'm not disagreeable to you and i believe it for i don't see why that should be i shall always think of you
i_331.wav	i shall never think of any one else i came to england simply because you are here i couldn't stay at home after you had gone i hated the country because you were not in it if i like this country at present
it_332.wav	it is only because it holds you i have been to england before but have never enjoyed it much may i not come and see you for half an hour this at present is the dearest wish of yours faithfully
caspar_333.wav	caspar goodwood isabel read this missive with such deep attention that she had not perceived an approaching tread on the soft grass
had_334.wav	had laid before her a pair of alternatives now of course you're completely your own mistress and are as free as the bird on the bough i don't mean you were not so before but you're at present on a different footing
property_335.wav	property erects a kind of barrier you can do a great many things if you're rich which would be severely criticised if you were poor you can go and come you can travel alone you can have your own establishment
i_336.wav	i mean of course if you'll take a companion some decayed gentlewoman with a darned cashmere and dyed hair who paints on velvet you don't think you'd like that of course you can do as you please
shed_337.wav	she'd keep people off very well i think
that_338.wav	that it's a great deal better you should remain with me in spite of there being no obligation it's better for several reasons quite apart from your liking it i shouldn't think you'd like it but i recommend you to make the sacrifice
she_339.wav	she had a great regard for what was usually deemed decent and a young gentlewoman without visible relations had always struck her as a flower without foliage
when_340.wav	when she sat in her damp waterproof and sketched the opportunities that europe would offer to a young person of taste this however was in a great measure the girl's own fault she had got a glimpse of her aunt's experience
and_341.wav	and her imagination constantly anticipated the judgements and emotions of a woman who had very little of the same faculty apart from this missus touchett had a great merit she was as honest as a pair of compasses
but_342.wav	but was never over inquisitive as regards the territory of her neighbour isabel came at last to have a kind of undemonstrable pity for her there seemed something so dreary in the condition of a person whose nature had as it were
so_343.wav	so little surface offered so limited a face to the accretions of human contact nothing tender nothing sympathetic had ever had a chance to fasten upon it
no_344.wav	no wind sown blossom no familiar softening moss her offered her passive extent in other words was about that of a knife edge isabel had reason to believe none the less
she_345.wav	she was learning to sacrifice consistency to considerations of that inferior order for which the excuse must be found in the particular case it was not to the credit of her absolute rectitude
that_346.wav	that she should have gone the longest way round to florence in order to spend a few weeks with her invalid son
that_347.wav	that when ralph wished to see her he was at liberty to remember that palazzo crescentini contained a large apartment known as the quarter of the signorino i want to ask you something
isabel_348.wav	isabel said to this young man the day after her arrival at san remo something i've thought more than once of asking you by letter but that i've hesitated on the whole to write about face to face nevertheless
what_349.wav	what does it matter my dear isabel whether i knew my father was very obstinate so said the girl you did know yes he told me we even talked it over a little
asked_350.wav	asked isabel abruptly why as a kind of compliment a compliment on what on your so beautifully existing he liked me too much she presently declared that's a way we all have
if_351.wav	if i believed that i should be very unhappy fortunately i don't believe it i want to be treated with justice i want nothing but that very good but you must remember that justice to a lovely being
is_352.wav	is after all a florid sort of sentiment i'm not a lovely being how can you say that at the very moment when i'm asking such odious questions i must seem to you delicate
you_353.wav	you seem to me troubled said ralph i am troubled about what for a moment she answered nothing then she broke out do you think it good for me suddenly to be made so rich
henrietta_354.wav	henrietta doesn't oh hang henrietta said ralph coarsely if you ask me i'm delighted at it is that why your father did it for your amusement i differ with miss stackpole
ralph_355.wav	ralph went on more gravely i think it very good for you to have means isabel looked at him with serious eyes i wonder whether you know what's good for me or whether you care if i know depend upon it i care
dont_356.wav	don't question your conscience so much it will get out of tune like a strummed piano keep it for great occasions don't try so much to form your character it's like trying to pull open a tight tender young rose
live_357.wav	live as you like best and your character will take care of itself most things are good for you the exceptions are very rare and a comfortable income's not one of them ralph paused smiling
isabel_358.wav	isabel had listened quickly you've too much power of thought above all too much conscience ralph added it's out of all reason the number of things you think wrong put back your watch diet your fever
its_359.wav	it's never wrong to do that she had listened eagerly as i say and it was her nature to understand quickly i wonder if you appreciate what you say if you do you take a great responsibility you frighten me a little
but_360.wav	but i think i'm right said ralph persisting in cheer all the same what you say is very true isabel pursued you could say nothing more true i'm absorbed in myself i look at life too much as a doctor's prescription
why_361.wav	why indeed should we perpetually be thinking whether things are good for us as if we were patients lying in a hospital why should i be so afraid of not doing right as if it mattered to the world whether i do right or wrong
youre_362.wav	you're a capital person to advise said ralph you take the wind out of my sails she looked at him as if she had not heard him though she was following out the train of reflexion which he himself had kindled
a_363.wav	a large fortune means freedom and i'm afraid of that it's such a fine thing and one should make such a good use of it if one shouldn't one would be ashamed and one must keep thinking it's a constant effort
im_364.wav	i'm not sure it's not a greater happiness to be powerless for weak people i've no doubt it's a greater happiness for weak people the effort not to be contemptible must be great and how do you know i'm not weak isabel asked
the_365.wav	the gate of admirations italy as yet imperfectly seen and felt stretched before her as a land of promise a land in which a love of the beautiful might be comforted by endless knowledge
whenever_366.wav	whenever she strolled upon the shore with her cousin and she was the companion of his daily walk she looked across the sea with longing eyes to where she knew that genoa lay
she_367.wav	she was glad to pause however on the edge of this larger adventure there was such a thrill even in the preliminary hovering it affected her moreover as a peaceful interlude as a hush of the drum and fife in a career which she had little warrant
as_368.wav	as yet for regarding as agitated but which nevertheless she was constantly picturing to herself by the light of her hopes her fears her fancies her ambitions her predilections
madame_369.wav	madame merle had predicted to missus touchett that after their young friend had put her hand into her pocket half a dozen times she would be reconciled to the idea that it had been filled by a munificent uncle
grown_370.wav	grown used to feeling rich the consciousness in question found a proper place in rather a dense little group of ideas that she had about herself and often it was by no means the least agreeable
it_371.wav	it took perpetually for granted a thousand good intentions she lost herself in a maze of visions the fine things to be done by a rich independent generous girl who took a large human view of occasions and obligations
were_372.wav	were sublime in the mass her fortune therefore became to her mind a part of her better self it gave her importance gave her even to her own imagination a certain ideal beauty
which_373.wav	which in spite of increasing distance were still sufficiently salient they were recognisable without difficulty
she_374.wav	she could summon back her faith in case of need with an effort but the effort was often painful even when the reality had been pleasant the past was apt to look dead and its revival rather to show the
livid_375.wav	livid light of a judgement day the girl moreover was not prone to take for granted that she herself lived in the mind of others
she_376.wav	she was capable of being wounded by the discovery that she had been forgotten but of all liberties the one she herself found sweetest was the liberty to forget she had not given her last shilling sentimentally speaking
either_377.wav	either to caspar goodwood or to lord warburton and yet couldn't but feel them appreciably in debt to her she had of course reminded herself that she was to hear from mister goodwood again but this was not to be for another year and a half
and_378.wav	and in that time a great many things might happen she had indeed failed to say to herself that her american suitor might find some other girl more comfortable to woo because though it was certain many other girls would prove so
she_379.wav	she had not the smallest belief that this merit would attract him but she reflected that she herself might know the humiliation of change might really for that matter come to the end of the things that were not caspar
a_380.wav	a clear and quiet harbour enclosed by a brave granite breakwater but that day could only come in its order and she couldn't wait for it with folded hands that lord warburton should continue to cherish her image
seemed_381.wav	seemed to her more than a noble humility or an enlightened pride ought to wish to reckon with she had so definitely undertaken to preserve no record of what had passed between them that a corresponding effort on his own part
would_382.wav	would be eminently just this was not as it may seem merely a theory tinged with sarcasm isabel candidly believed that his lordship would in the usual phrase get over his disappointment
he_383.wav	he had been deeply affected this she believed and she was still capable of deriving pleasure from the belief but it was absurd that a man both so intelligent and so honourably dealt with
should_384.wav	should cultivate a scar out of proportion to any wound englishmen liked moreover to be comfortable said isabel and there could be little comfort for lord warburton in the long run in brooding over a self sufficient american girl
who_385.wav	who had been but a casual acquaintance she flattered herself that should she hear from one day to another that he had married some young woman of his own country who had done more to deserve him
she_386.wav	she should receive the news without a pang even of surprise it would have proved that he believed she was firm which was what she wished to seem to him
before_387.wav	before the sittings of the great assembly had come to an end a young statesman destined to play the leading part in the government of the dutch republic during two decades had already made his mark
his_388.wav	his readiness and persuasiveness of speech his industry and his gifts at once of swift insight and orderly thoroughness
but_389.wav	but the old sores remained open moreover the refusal of the states general to receive the parliamentary envoys the murder of doreslaer and the protection afforded to royalist refugees had been additional causes of resentment
but_390.wav	but the english council had not felt strong enough to take action the death of the prince of orange
appeared_391.wav	appeared at first to open out a prospect of friendlier relations between the two neighbouring republics in january sixteen fifty one the great assembly formally recognised the commonwealth
and_392.wav	and determined to send back to his old post in london the veteran ambassador joachimi who had been recalled the english government on their part anticipated his return by despatching in march oliver saint john and walter strickland
and_393.wav	and saint john and strickland greeted with loud cries of regicides and many abusive epithets remembering the fate of doreslaer were in fear of their lives
on_394.wav	on april fourth a conference was opened between the envoys and six commissioners appointed by the states to consider the proposals of the english government for a more strict and intimate alliance and union between the two states the dutch quickly perceived
that_395.wav	that what the english really wanted was nothing less than such a binding alliance or rather coalition as would practically merge the lesser state in the greater but the very idea of such a loss of the independence that they had only just won was to the netherlanders unthinkable
the_396.wav	the negotiations came to a deadlock
foremost_397.wav	foremost amongst them prince edward son of the queen of bohemia the parliament threatened to recall the envoys but consented that they should remain on the undertaking of the estates of holland to protect them from further attacks and to punish the offenders
new_398.wav	new proposals were accordingly made for an offensive and defensive alliance without any suggestion of a union coupled with the condition that both states should bind themselves not to allow the presence within their boundaries of avowed enemies of the other in other words
the_399.wav	the expulsion of the members and adherents of the house of stewart including the princess royal and the queen of bohemia with their children
even_400.wav	even the estates of holland dared not consider such terms and the states general would have angrily rejected them after some further parleying therefore about fisheries and trade restrictions it was felt that no agreement could be reached
and_401.wav	and saint john and strickland returned to england on july thirty first sixteen fifty one their failure created a very bad impression upon the parliament all the old complaints against the dutch were revived and
as_402.wav	as they had refused the offer of friendship that had been made to them it was resolved that strong measures should be taken to obtain redress for past grievances and for the protection of english trade interests at the instance of saint john
the_403.wav	the famous navigation act was passed by the parliament october ninth sixteen fifty one this act struck a mortal blow at the dutch carrying trade by forbidding the importation of foreign goods into english ports except in english bottoms or in those of the countries which had produced the goods
scarcely_404.wav	scarcely less injurious was the prohibition to aliens to fish in british waters and the withdrawal of the rights based on the magnus intercursus for the maintenance of which dutch statesmen had so long and strenuously fought
there_405.wav	there was consternation in holland and the states general determined to send a special embassy to london
a_406.wav	a man in whose ripe judgment they had confidence to the office of council pensionary
who_407.wav	who having been given letters of marque to prey upon french commerce
the_408.wav	the english government however met the dutch complaints by raking up the long list of grievances that had stirred up a bitter feeling of popular hatred against the united provinces in england and by demanding reparation
they_409.wav	they further demanded that dutch commanders should acknowledge england's sovereignty by striking flag and sail and by firing a salute whenever any of their squadrons met english ships in the narrow seas it was these last two questions
the_410.wav	the right of search and the striking of the flag that were to be the real causes of the outbreak of a war that was desired by neither of the two governments but popular feeling and the course of events was too strong for them the news of the seizure of their vessels
not_411.wav	not merely by privateers but by an english squadron under ayscue in the west indies had caused intense indignation and alarm in holland and especially in amsterdam pressure was brought to bear on the states general and the admiralties
who_412.wav	who in pursuance of economy had reduced the fleet to seventy five ships it was resolved therefore on february twenty second
the_413.wav	the council of state on hearing of this began also to make ready for eventualities negotiations were still proceeding between the two countries when martin tromp the victor of the battle of the downs
now_414.wav	now lieutenant admiral of holland was sent to sea with fifty ships and instructions to protect dutch merchantmen from interference and to see that the states suffered no affront nothing was actually said about the striking of the flag
it_415.wav	it came suddenly through a misunderstanding the dutch admiral while cruising past dover met on may twenty ninth fifteen english ships under blake
tromp_416.wav	tromp declared that he had given orders to strike the flag but that blake again fired before there was time to carry them out be this as it may the two fleets were soon engaged in a regular fight and the english being reinforced tromp withdrew at nightfall
to_417.wav	to the french coast having lost two ships great was the anger aroused in england where the dutch were universally regarded as the aggressors in the netherlands where the peace party was strong many were disposed to blame tromp despite his protests
adrian_418.wav	adrian pauw himself left hastily for london john de witt being appointed to act as his deputy during his absence pauw's strenuous efforts however to maintain peace were all in vain despite the strong leanings of cromwell towards a peaceful solution
but_419.wav	but popular feeling on both sides was now aroused
if_420.wav	if humiliating terms were submitted to stiffened their attitude the result was that the envoys left london on june thirtieth sixteen fifty two and war was declared the dutch statesmen who sought to avoid hostilities were right
all_421.wav	all the advantages were on the side of their enemies the dutch merchant fleets covered the seas and the welfare of the land depended on commerce the english had little to lose commercially
was_422.wav	was superior in almost all other respects the stuarts had devoted great attention to the fleet and would have done more but for lack of means charles much abused ship money was employed by him for the creation of the first english professional navy
it_423.wav	it had been largely increased by the parliament after sixteen forty eight and its generals blake penn and ayscue had already acquired much valuable experience in their encounters with the royalist squadron under prince rupert
and_424.wav	and in long cruises to the west indies for the purpose of forcing the english colonies to acknowledge parliamentary rule the crews therefore were well trained and the ships were larger stronger and better armed than those of the dutch
the_425.wav	the position of england lying as it did athwart the routes by which the dutch merchant fleets must sail was a great advantage even more important was the advantage of having a central control
whereas_426.wav	whereas in the netherlands there were five distinct boards of admiralty to some extent jealous of each other and now lacking the supreme direction of an admiral general the war began by a series of english successes and of dutch misfortunes
early_427.wav	early in july sixteen fifty two blake at the head of sixty ships set sail for the north to intercept the dutch baltic commerce and to destroy their fishing fleet off the north of scotland
he_428.wav	he left ayscue with a small squadron to guard the mouth of the thames tromp meanwhile had put to sea at the head of nearly a hundred ships ayscue succeeded in intercepting a fleet of dutch merchantmen near calais
all_429.wav	all of them being captured or burnt while blake with the main force off the north coast of scotland destroyed the dutch fishing fleet and their convoy after these first blows against the enemy's commerce good fortune continued to attend the english
tromp_430.wav	tromp was prevented from following blake by strong northerly winds he then turned upon ayscue whose small force he must have overwhelmed but for a sudden change to a southerly gale the dutch admiral now sailed northwards and july twenty fifth
found_431.wav	found the english fleet off the shetlands a violent storm arose from the force of which blake was protected while the dutch vessels were scattered far and wide on the following day out of ninety nine ships tromp could only collect thirty five
and_432.wav	and to meet and convoy back the home coming ships
ayscue_433.wav	ayscue had previously sailed up channel with forty men of war and five fireships for a similar purpose the two fleets met on august sixteenth and despite his inferiority of force de ruyter forced ayscue to withdraw into plymouth and was able to bring his convoy home to safety
the_434.wav	the ill success of tromp though he was in no way to blame for it caused considerable alarm and discontent in holland his enemies of the states party in that province took advantage of it to suspend the gallant old seaman from his command he was an orangist
and_435.wav	and as the orange partisans were everywhere clamorously active the admiral was suspect in his place cornelisz witte de with was appointed a capable sailor but disliked in the fleet as much as tromp was beloved de with effected a junction with de ruyter
and_436.wav	and with joint forces they attacked blake on october eighth near the shoal known as the kentish knock the english fleet was considerably more powerful than the dutch and the desertion of de with by some twenty ships decided the issue the dutch had to return home with some loss
but_437.wav	but they were deceived in thinking that the struggle in the channel was over for the winter the deserters at the kentish knock were punished
full_438.wav	full of resentment though he was at the bad treatment he had received tromp was too good a patriot to refuse at the end of november the old admiral at the head of one hundred warships put to sea for the purpose of convoying some four hundred fifty merchantmen through the straits
stormy_439.wav	stormy weather compelled him to send the convoy with an escort into shelter but he himself with sixty ships set out to seek the english fleet which lay in the downs after some manoeuvring the two fleets met on december tenth off dungeness
while_440.wav	while many english prizes were captured this state of things was however not to last long towards the end of february sixteen fifty three blake put to sea with nearly eighty ships and on the twenty fifth off portland met tromp at the head of a force nearly equal to his own in number
and_441.wav	and he had moreover been at sea without replenishment of stores ever since the fight at dungeness while the english had come straight from port the fight
had_442.wav	had lasted for two whole days when tromp found that his powder had run out and that on the third day more than half his fleet were unable to continue the struggle but inspiring his subordinates de ruyter evertsen and floriszoon with his own indomitable courage
tromp_443.wav	tromp succeeded by expert seamanship in holding off the enemy and conducting his convoy with small loss into safety
meanwhile_444.wav	meanwhile both nations had been getting sick of the war the dutch were suffering terribly from the serious interference with their commerce and carrying trade and from the destruction of the important fisheries industry
while_445.wav	while the english on their side were shut out from the baltic where the king of denmark as the ally of the united provinces had closed the sound and from the mediterranean where admiral van galen
destroyed_446.wav	destroyed a british squadron off leghorn march twenty third in both countries there was a peace party
and_447.wav	and was averse to war in the dutch republic the states party especially in holland the chief sufferer by the war was anxious for a cessation of hostilities and it found its leader in the youthful john de witt
had_448.wav	had been appointed council pensionary cromwell took pains to let the estates of holland know his favourable feelings towards them by sending over in february a private emissary
thus_449.wav	thus early did the new council pensionary initiate a form of diplomacy in which he was to prove himself an adept this first effort was not a success the parliament published the letter with the title humble supplication of the states of holland
he_450.wav	he induced the states general by a bare majority four provinces to three to send a conciliatory letter the date of which april thirtieth sixteen fifty three coincided with cromwell's forcible dissolution of the rump parliament and the assumption by him
with_451.wav	with the support of the army of dictatorial powers
and_452.wav	and their insistence now on the full satisfaction of all the english demands made a continuation of hostilities inevitable tromp after successfully bringing in two large convoys of merchantmen encountered june twelfth
near_453.wav	near the gabbard the english fleet under monk and deane each fleet numbered about one hundred sail but the dutch ships were inferior in size solidity and weight of metal for two days the fight was obstinately and fiercely contested
tromp_454.wav	tromp was obliged to retreat having lost twenty ships he complained bitterly as did his vice admirals de ruyter and de with to the board of admiralty of the inferiority of the vessels of his fleet as compared with those of the adversary
the_455.wav	the english now instituted a blockade of the dutch coast which had the effect of reducing to desperate straits a land whose welfare and prosperity depended wholly on commerce amsterdam was ruined in these circumstances direct negotiation was perforce attempted
four_456.wav	four envoys were sent representing the three maritime provinces at first it seemed impossible that any common ground of agreement could be found cromwell was obsessed with the idea of a politico religious union between the two republics which would have meant the extinction of dutch independence
una_457.wav	una respublica which nothing but sheer conquest and dire necessity would ever induce the dutch people to accept accordingly the war went on though the envoys did not leave london hoping still that some better terms might be offered
but_458.wav	but in order to gain breathing space for the efforts of the negotiators one thing was essential the breaking of the blockade the admiralties made a supreme effort to refit and reinforce their fleet but it lay in two portions eighty five sail under tromp in the maas
monk_459.wav	monk with about one hundred ships lay between them to prevent their junction on august fourth tromp sailed out and after a rearguard action off katwijk out manoeuvred the english commander and joined de with he now turned and with superior numbers attacked monk off scheveningen
the_460.wav	the old hero fell mortally wounded at the very beginning of what proved to be an unequal fight
the_461.wav	the states though much perplexed to find a successor to martin tromp were so far from being discouraged that great energy was shown in reorganising the fleet
meanwhile_462.wav	meanwhile negotiations had been slowly dragging on the accession of cromwell to supreme power in december sixteen fifty three with the title of lord protector
for_463.wav	for the new ruler of england had always professed himself an opponent of the war which had shattered his fantastic dream of a union between the two republics many conferences took place but the protector's attitude and intentions were ambiguous and difficult to divine
at_464.wav	at last cromwell formulated his proposals in twenty seven articles the demands were those of the victor and were severe all the old disputes were to be settled in favour of england an annual sum was to be paid for the right of fishing
compensation_465.wav	compensation to be made for the massacre of amboina and the officials responsible for it punished the number of warships in english waters was to be limited the flag had to be struck when english ships were met and the right of search to be permitted these demands
article_466.wav	article twelve stipulated that the prince of orange should not at any time hold any of the offices or dignities which had been held by his ancestors or be appointed to any military command
was_467.wav	was perfectly aware that it would be useless to present such proposals to the states general not only would they indignantly reject them but he had not the slightest hope of getting any single province even holland to allow a foreign power to interfere with their internal affairs
and_468.wav	and to bid them to treat with harsh ingratitude the infant heir of a family to which the dutch people owed so deep a debt there was nothing for it but to prepare for a vigorous resumption of the war strong efforts were therefore made at de witt's instigation
to_469.wav	to increase the fleet and secure the active co operation of denmark and france both friendly to the states but cromwell really wanted peace and showed himself ready to yield on certain minor points but he continued to insist on the exclusion of the prince of orange
not_470.wav	not till the dutch envoys had demanded their passports did the protector give way so far as to say he would be content to have the exclusion guaranteed by a secret article what followed forms one of the strangest chapters in the history of diplomacy
he_471.wav	he was able to reach the private ear of cromwell and to enter into clandestine negotiations with him the council pensionary knew well the hopelessness of any attempt to get the assent of the states general to the proposed exclusion even in a secret article
of_472.wav	of the state of public feeling on this point with the result that the protector gave the envoy to understand that he would be satisfied if the estates of holland alone would affirm a declaration that the prince should never be appointed stadholder or captain general whether this concession was offered by cromwell proprio motu
in_473.wav	in any case the council pensionary being convinced of the necessity of peace resolved to secure it by playing a very deep and dangerous game not only must the whole affair be kept absolutely from the cognisance of the states general
but_474.wav	but also de witt was fully aware that the assent of the estates of holland to the proposed exclusion article could only be obtained with the greatest difficulty he was to prove himself a very past master in the art of diplomatic chicanery and intrigue
the_475.wav	the council pensionary first set to work to have the treaty from which the exclusion article had been cut out ratified rapidly by the states general
the_476.wav	the estates adjourned for a recess on april twenty first sixteen fifty four on the following day he presented the treaty to the states general
and_477.wav	and such was his persuasive skill that he accomplished the unprecedented feat of getting this dilatory body to accept the conditions of peace almost without discussion
the_478.wav	the treaty ratified and signed was sent back to london only one article aroused opposition
the_479.wav	the so called temperament clause but cromwell had insisted upon it by this article
or_480.wav	or commander of military or naval forces
addressed_481.wav	addressed to the estates of holland not at the moment in session
the_482.wav	the cleverness and skill now shown by the council pensionary were truly extraordinary a summons was sent out to the estates to meet on april twenty eighth without any reason being assigned the members on assembly were sworn to secrecy
and_483.wav	and then the official letter from london was read to them
to_484.wav	to the act of exclusion came upon the estates like a thunder bolt the sudden demand caused something like consternation and the members asked to be allowed to consider the matter with their principals before taking so momentous a decision three days were granted
but_485.wav	but as it was essential to prevent publicity it was settled that only the burgomasters should be consulted again under oath of secrecy at the meeting on may first
that_486.wav	that the act should be placed in his hands within two days after the ratification of the treaty was peremptory and threatening unless he received the act he would consider the treaty as not binding upon him using all his powers of advocacy
de_487.wav	de witt succeeded after an angry debate in securing a majority for the act five towns however obstinately refused their assent and claimed that it could not be passed without it but de witt had made up his mind to risk illegality
and_488.wav	and overruled their protest the act was declared to have been passed and was on may fifth sent to van beverningh and nieuwpoort with instructions not to deliver it until circumstances compelled them to do so
but_489.wav	but for some five weeks the existence of the act was unknown to the states general and during that period
early_490.wav	early in june a bribe induced one of de witt's clerks to betray the secret to count william frederick the news soon spread and loud was the outcry of the orange partisans and of the two princesses who at once addressed a remonstrance to the states general
all_491.wav	all the other provinces strongly protested against the action of the estates of holland and of the council pensionary de witt attempted to defend himself and the estates by vague statements avoiding the main issue but insisting that nothing illegal had been done his efforts were in vain
all_492.wav	all the secret instructions they had received from holland and the act of exclusion meanwhile the estates of holland themselves frightened at the clamour which had been aroused began to show signs of defection
they_493.wav	they went so far as to pass a vote of thanks to the envoys for not having delivered the act to cromwell de witt's position appeared hopeless
his_494.wav	his efforts to prevent the resolution of the states general from taking immediate effect proving unavailing he put forward the suggestion that on account of its importance the despatch should be sent to the envoys in cipher
this_495.wav	this was agreed to and on june seventh the document was duly forwarded to london by the council pensionary
informing_496.wav	informing them that the estates of holland assented to the request made by the states general and that they were to send back the secret correspondence and also the act if it were still undelivered the result answered to his expectations
while_497.wav	while the clerk was laboriously deciphering the despatch the envoys read between the lines of de witt's letter and without a moment's delay went to whitehall and placed the act in cromwell's hands the states general had thus no alternative between acceptance of the fait accompli
and_498.wav	and the risk of a renewal of the war no further action was taken and the protector professed himself satisfied with a guarantee of such doubtful validity it is impossible to withhold admiration from de witt's marvellous diplomatic dexterity
and_499.wav	and from the skill and courage with which he achieved his end in the face of obstacles and difficulties that seemed insurmountable but for the course of double dealing and chicanery by which he triumphed the only defence that can be offered is that the council pensionary
really_500.wav	really believed that peace was an absolute necessity for his country and that peace could only be maintained at the cost of the act of exclusion
there_501.wav	there is however every reason to believe that de witt was prompted to take the risks he did by purely patriotic motives and not through spite against the house of orange
not_502.wav	not merely by the orange partisans but by popular opinion generally in the united provinces

what_558.wav	what would justify the use of such an awful weapon she asked it is amply justified to secure an end he said blandly for example i want something i cannot obtain that something through the ordinary channel or by the employment of ordinary means
if_559.wav	if i can buy it well and good if i can buy those who can use their influence to secure this thing for me so much the better if i can obtain it by any merit i possess i utilize that merit
providing_560.wav	providing always that i can secure my object in the time otherwise he shrugged his shoulders i see she said nodding her head quickly i suppose that is how blackmailers feel he frowned
that_561.wav	that is a word i never use nor do i like to hear it employed he said blackmail suggests to me a vulgar attempt to obtain money
and_562.wav	and according to your argument they are also justified it is a matter of plane he said airily viewed from my standpoint they are sordid criminals the sort of person that t x meets i presume in the course of his daily work
t_563.wav	t x he went on somewhat oracularly is a man for whom i have a great deal of respect you will probably meet him again for he will find an opportunity of asking you a few questions about myself i need hardly tell you
he_564.wav	he lifted his shoulders with a deprecating smile i shall certainly not discuss your business with any person said the girl coldly i am paying you three pounds a week i think he said
i_565.wav	i intend increasing that to five pounds because you suit me most admirably thank you said the girl quietly but i am already being paid quite sufficient she left him a little astonished and not a little ruffled
to_566.wav	to refuse the favours of remington kara was by him regarded as something of an affront

detain_568.wav	detain him on some pretext or other because he is rather difficult to get hold of and i want to see him

closed_571.wav	closed the door carefully and returned to the house
that_572.wav	that he should return to kara's study and set the papers in order was natural and proper that he should conduct a rapid examination of all the drawers in kara's desk might be excused on the score of diligence since he was to some extent in the confidence of his employer
kara_573.wav	kara was given to making friends of his servants up to a point in his more generous moments he would address his bodyguard as fred and on more occasions than one and for no apparent reason had tipped his servant over and above his salary
mister_574.wav	mister fred fisher found little to reward him for his search until he came upon kara's cheque book which told him that on the previous day the greek had drawn six thousand pounds in cash from the bank
this_575.wav	this interested him mightily and he replaced the cheque book with the tightened lips and the fixed gaze of a man who was thinking rapidly he paid a visit to the library where the secretary was engaged in making copies of kara's correspondence
answering_576.wav	answering letters appealing for charitable donations and in the hack words which fall to the secretaries of the great he replenished the fire asked deferentially for any instructions and returned again to his quest

there_579.wav	there was a little knob for the purpose and let it fall gently into the socket which had been made to receive it on the door itself rum cove he said again and lifting the latch to the hook which held it up left the room closing the door softly behind him
he_580.wav	he walked down the corridor with a meditative frown and began to descend the stairs to the hall he was less than half way down when the one maid of kara's household came up to meet him there's a gentleman who wants to see mister kara she said here is his card
fisher_581.wav	fisher took the card from the salver and read mister george gathercole junior travellers club i'll see this gentleman he said with a sudden brisk interest he found the visitor standing in the hall
he_582.wav	he was a man who would have attracted attention if only from the somewhat eccentric nature of his dress and his unkempt appearance he was dressed in a well worn overcoat of a somewhat pronounced check he had a top hat glossy and obviously new at the back of his head
a_583.wav	a pair of pince nez sat crookedly on his nose and two fat volumes under his arm completed the picture fisher who was an observer of some discernment noticed under the overcoat a creased blue suit large black boots
and_584.wav	and a pair of pearl studs the newcomer glared round at the valet take these he ordered peremptorily pointing to the books under his arm fisher hastened to obey and noted with some wonder that the visitor did not attempt to assist him
either_585.wav	either by loosening his hold of the volumes or raising his hand accidentally the valet's hand pressed against the other's sleeve and he received a shock for the forearm was clearly an artificial one it was against a wooden surface beneath the sleeve that his knuckles struck
and_586.wav	and this view of the stranger's infirmity was confirmed when the other reached round with his right hand took hold of the gloved left hand and thrust it into the pocket of his overcoat where is kara growled the stranger
he_587.wav	he told me he would be in at six o'clock at the latest six o'clock ye gods stormed the man impatiently what dog am i that i should wait till six
six_588.wav	six o'clock eh you will tell mister kara that i called give me those books but i assure you sir stammered fisher give me those books roared the other

good_590.wav	good morning to you if you would only wait sir pleaded the agonized fisher wait be hanged snarled the other i've waited three years i tell you tell mister kara to expect me when he sees me he went out and most unnecessarily banged the door behind him
fisher_591.wav	fisher went back to the library the girl was sealing up some letters as he entered and looked up i am afraid miss holland i've got myself into very serious trouble what is that fisher asked the girl
mister_592.wav	mister gathercole said the girl quickly fisher nodded yes miss i couldn't get him to stay though she pursed her lips thoughtfully mister kara will be very cross but i don't see how you can help it i wish you had called me
at_593.wav	at six o'clock miss the man replied there is rather an important letter here which has to be delivered shall i ring up for a messenger no i don't think that would be advisable you had better take it yourself

the_596.wav	the only other person in the house beside the girl was the middle aged domestic who was parlour maid serving maid and housekeeper in one miss holland sat at her desk to all appearance reading over the letters she had typed that afternoon
but_597.wav	but her mind was very far from the correspondence before her she heard the soft thud of the front door closing and rising she crossed the room rapidly and looked down through the window to the street she watched fisher until he was out of sight
the_598.wav	the maid who was also cook arose up as the girl entered it's a sight for sore eyes to see you in my kitchen miss she smiled i'm afraid you're rather lonely missus beale said the girl sympathetically lonely miss cried the maid

the_602.wav	the girl ascended to the upper floor again she watched from the window the disappearing figure once out of sight miss holland went to work with a remarkable deliberation and thoroughness from her bag she produced a small purse and opened it
in_603.wav	in that case was a new steel key
in_604.wav	in two seconds it was open and she was examining its contents it was a large safe of the usual type there were four steel drawers fitted at the back and at the bottom of the strong box
an_605.wav	an examination of the first drawer did not produce all that she had expected she returned the papers to the drawer pushed it to and locked it she gave her attention to the second drawer her hand shook a little as she pulled it open
it_606.wav	it was a square case covered in red morocco leather she inserted her shaking hand and took it out with a triumphant little cry at last she said aloud and then a hand grasped her wrist and in a panic she turned to meet the smiling face
chapter_607.wav	chapter twelve kara lay back on his down pillows with a sneer on his face and his brain very busy what started the train of thought he did not know but at that moment his mind was very far away
it_608.wav	it carried him back a dozen years to a dirty little peasant's cabin on the hillside outside durazzo to the livid face of a young albanian chief who had lost at kara's whim all that life held for a man
to_609.wav	to the hateful eyes of the girl's father who stood with folded arms glaring down at the bound and manacled figure on the floor to the smoke stained rafters of this peasant cottage and the dancing shadows on the roof
to_610.wav	to that terrible hour of waiting when he sat bound to a post with a candle flickering and spluttering lower and lower to the little heap of gunpowder that would start the trail toward the clumsy infernal machine under his chair
he_611.wav	he remembered the day well because it was candlemas day and this was the anniversary he remembered other things more pleasant
he_612.wav	he remembered with a savage joy the spectacle of his would be assassins twitching and struggling on the gallows at pezara and

kara_614.wav	kara breathed a sigh of relief and his face was wreathed in smiles why of course tell him to come up ask him if he minds seeing me in my room i told him you were in bed sir and he used shocking language said fisher kara laughed send him up he said
yes_615.wav	yes sir said the servant such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him there was much that he had to do and that night's freedom would assist him materially perhaps kara hesitated perhaps you had better wait until eleven o'clock
bring_616.wav	bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk or better still place them on a plate in the hall very good sir said the man and withdrew down below that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged beard was walking up and down the tesselated hallway
muttering_617.wav	muttering to himself and staring at the various objects in the hall with a certain amused antagonism mister kara will see you sir said fisher oh said the other glaring at the unoffending fisher that's very good of him
yes_618.wav	yes sir said fisher look here the man thrust out his face do you see those grey hairs in my beard the embarrassed fisher grinned is it grey challenged the visitor with a roar
yes_619.wav	yes sir said the valet hastily is it real grey insisted the visitor pull one out and see the startled fisher drew back with an apologetic smile i couldn't think of doing a thing like that sir oh you couldn't sneered the visitor
then_620.wav	then lead on fisher showed the way up the stairs this time the traveller carried no books his left arm hung limply by his side and fisher privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the detaining pocket without its owner being aware of the fact
he_621.wav	he pushed open the door and announced mister gathercole and kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent who with top hat still on the top of his head and his overcoat dangling about his heels must have made a remarkable picture
fisher_622.wav	fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the hall below ten minutes later he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him fisher went up the stairs to meet him and found him addressing the occupant of the room in his own eccentric fashion
no_623.wav	no more patagonia he roared no more tierra del fuego he paused certainly he replied to some question but not patagonia he paused again
and_624.wav	and fisher standing at the foot of the stairs wondered what had occurred to make the visitor so genial i suppose your cheque will be honoured all right asked the visitor sardonically and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door
damn_625.wav	damn all greeks he said jovially and fisher could do no more than smile reproachfully the smile being his very own the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him the traveller touched the other on the chest with his right hand never trust a greek he said
always_626.wav	always get your money in advance is that clear to you yes sir said fisher but i think you will always find that mister kara is always most generous about money don't you believe it don't you believe it my poor man said the other you
at_627.wav	at that moment there came from kara's room a faint clang what's that asked the visitor a little startled mister kara's put down his steel latch said fisher with a smile which means that he is not to be disturbed until he looked at his watch
until_628.wav	until eleven o'clock at any rate he's a funk snapped the other a beastly funk he stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread opened the front door without assistance slammed it behind him and disappeared into the night
as_629.wav	as if the young lady had been in a position to appeal to it but in fact the british public remained for the present profoundly indifferent to miss isabel archer whose fortune had dropped her as her cousin said into the dullest house in england
her_630.wav	her gouty uncle received very little company and missus touchett not having cultivated relations with her husband's neighbours was not warranted in expecting visits from them she had however a peculiar taste she liked to receive cards
for_631.wav	for what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard she flattered herself that she was a very just woman
and_632.wav	and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing she had played no social part as mistress of gardencourt and it was not to be supposed that in the surrounding country a minute account should be kept of her comings and goings
but_633.wav	but it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and that her failure really very gratuitous to make herself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions to her husband's adopted country
isabel_634.wav	isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the british constitution against her aunt
isabel_635.wav	isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness
she_636.wav	she was very critical herself it was incidental to her age her sex and her nationality but she was very sentimental as well and there was something in missus touchett's dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing now what's your point of view
she_637.wav	she asked of her aunt when you criticise everything here you should have a point of view yours doesn't seem to be american you thought everything over there so disagreeable when i criticise i have mine it's thoroughly american
there_638.wav	there are as many points of view in the world as there are people of sense to take them you may say that doesn't make them very numerous american never in the world that's shockingly narrow my point of view thank god is personal
isabel_639.wav	isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted it was a tolerable description of her own manner of judging but it would not have sounded well for her to say so
would_640.wav	would savour of immodesty even of arrogance
with_641.wav	with whom she talked a great deal and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave a large licence to extravagance her cousin used as the phrase is to chaff her
he_642.wav	he very soon established with her a reputation for treating everything as a joke and he was not a man to neglect the privileges such a reputation conferred
of_643.wav	of laughing at all things beginning with himself such slender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon his father for the rest he exercised his wit indifferently upon his father's son this gentleman's weak lungs
his_644.wav	his useless life his fantastic mother
his_645.wav	his adopted and his native country his charming new found cousin i keep a band of music in my ante room he said once to her it has orders to play without stopping it renders me two excellent services
it_646.wav	it keeps the sounds of the world from reaching the private apartments and it makes the world think that dancing's going on within
the_647.wav	the liveliest waltzes seemed to float upon the air isabel often found herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling
and_648.wav	and enter the private apartments it mattered little that he had assured her they were a very dismal place she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them and set them in order it was but half hospitality to let her remain outside
it_649.wav	it must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extent in self defence for her cousin amused himself with calling her columbia and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched he drew a caricature of her
in_650.wav	in the folds of the national banner isabel's chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrow minded what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so but she nevertheless
she_651.wav	she would be as american as it pleased him to regard her and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation she defended england against his mother but when ralph sang its praises on purpose as she said to work her up
she_652.wav	she found herself able to differ from him on a variety of points in fact the quality of this small ripe country seemed as sweet to her as the taste of an october pear
and_653.wav	and her satisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which enabled her to take her cousin's chaff
if_654.wav	if her good humour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself ill used but because she suddenly felt sorry for ralph it seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said
i_655.wav	i don't know what's the matter with you she observed to him once but i suspect you're a great humbug that's your privilege ralph answered who had not been used to being so crudely addressed i don't know what you care for
i_656.wav	i don't think you care for anything you don't really care for england when you praise it you don't care for america even when you pretend to abuse it i care for nothing but you dear cousin said ralph if i could believe
even_657.wav	even that i should be very glad ah well i should hope so the young man exclaimed isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth he thought a great deal about her she was constantly present to his mind
at_658.wav	at a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her sudden arrival which promised nothing and was an open handed gift of fate had refreshed and quickened them given them wings and something to fly for
poor_659.wav	poor ralph had been for many weeks steeped in melancholy his outlook habitually sombre lay under the shadow of a deeper cloud
the_660.wav	the old man had been gravely ill in the spring and the doctors had whispered to ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with just now he appeared disburdened of pain but ralph could not rid himself of a suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy
who_661.wav	who was waiting to take him off his guard if the manoeuvre should succeed there would be little hope of any great resistance ralph had always taken for granted that his father would survive him that his own name would be the first grimly called
the_662.wav	the father and son had been close companions and the idea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man who had always and tacitly counted upon his elder's help in making the best of a poor business
at_663.wav	at the prospect of losing his great motive ralph lost indeed his one inspiration
but_664.wav	but without the encouragement of his father's society he should barely have patience to await his own turn he had not the incentive of feeling that he was indispensable to his mother it was a rule with his mother to have no regrets
he_665.wav	he bethought himself of course that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that of the two the active rather than the passive party should know the felt wound he remembered that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as a clever fallacy
which_666.wav	which he should be delighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first but of the two triumphs that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which with all abatements he enjoyed
he_667.wav	he wondered whether he were harbouring love for this spontaneous young woman from albany but he judged that on the whole he was not after he had known her for a week he quite made up his mind to this and every day he felt a little more sure
lord_668.wav	lord warburton had been right about her she was a really interesting little figure ralph wondered how their neighbour had found it out so soon and then he said it was only another proof of his friend's high abilities
which_669.wav	which he had always greatly admired if his cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him ralph was conscious she was an entertainment of a high order a character like that he said to himself
a_670.wav	a real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature it's finer than the finest work of art than a greek bas relief
than_671.wav	than a gothic cathedral it's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it i had never been more blue more bored than for a week before she came i had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen
a_672.wav	a greek bas relief to stick over my chimney piece the key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand and i'm told to walk in and admire my poor boy you've been sadly ungrateful
and_673.wav	and now you had better keep very quiet and never grumble again the sentiment of these reflexions was very just
his_674.wav	his cousin was a very brilliant girl
but_675.wav	but she needed the knowing and his attitude with regard to her though it was contemplative and critical was not judicial he surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired it greatly
isabels_676.wav	isabel's originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own whenever she executes them said ralph may i be there to see it devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place
and_677.wav	and his wife's position was that of rather a grim visitor so that in the line of conduct that opened itself to ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed he was not a great walker but he strolled about the grounds with his cousin
a_678.wav	a pastime for which the weather remained favourable with a persistency not allowed for in isabel's somewhat lugubrious prevision of the climate and in the long afternoons of which the length was but the measure of her gratified eagerness
they_679.wav	they took a boat on the river the dear little river as isabel called it where the opposite shore seemed still a part of the foreground of the landscape or drove over the country in a phaeton a low capacious thick wheeled phaeton
but_680.wav	but which he had now ceased to enjoy isabel enjoyed it largely and handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to the groom as knowing was never weary of driving her uncle's capital horses through winding lanes and byways
full_681.wav	full of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find past cottages thatched and timbered past ale houses latticed and sanded past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks
between_682.wav	between hedgerows made thick by midsummer when they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn
but_683.wav	but the two for the most part sat silent the old man with his head back and his eyes closed his wife occupied with her knitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity with which some ladies consider the movement of their needles
one_684.wav	one day however a visitor had arrived the two young persons after spending an hour on the river strolled back to the house and perceived lord warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation
of_685.wav	of which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable with
he_686.wav	he had driven over from his own place with a portmanteau and had asked as the father and son often invited him to do for a dinner and a lodging isabel seeing him for half an hour on the day of her arrival had discovered in this brief space that she liked him
he_687.wav	he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and she had thought of him several times she had hoped she should see him again hoped too that she should see a few others gardencourt was not dull
the_688.wav	the place itself was sovereign her uncle was more and more a sort of golden grandfather and ralph was unlike any cousin she had ever encountered her idea of cousins having tended to gloom then
her_689.wav	her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view but isabel had need to remind herself that she was interested in human nature and that her foremost hope in coming abroad
had_690.wav	had been that she should see a great many people when ralph said to her as he had done several times i wonder you find this endurable you ought to see some of the neighbours and some of our friends
though_691.wav	though you would never suppose it when he offered to invite what he called a lot of people and make her acquainted with english society she encouraged the hospitable impulse and promised in advance to hurl herself into the fray
little_692.wav	little however for the present had come of his offers and it may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry them out it was because he found the labour of providing for his companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help
isabel_693.wav	isabel had spoken to him very often about specimens it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary she had given him to understand that she wished to see english society illustrated by eminent cases
well_694.wav	well now there's a specimen he said to her as they walked up from the riverside and he recognised lord warburton a specimen of what asked the girl a specimen of an english gentleman do you mean they're all like him
oh_695.wav	oh no they're not all like him
said_696.wav	said isabel because i'm sure he's nice
the_697.wav	the fortunate lord warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well but i needn't ask that he said since you've been handling the oars i've been rowing a little isabel answered but how should you know it
oh_698.wav	oh i know he doesn't row he's too lazy said his lordship indicating ralph touchett with a laugh he has a good excuse for his laziness isabel rejoined lowering her voice a little ah he has a good excuse for everything
cried_699.wav	cried lord warburton still with his sonorous mirth my excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well said ralph she does everything well she touches nothing that she doesn't adorn
it_700.wav	it makes one want to be touched miss archer lord warburton declared
who_701.wav	who if it pleased her to hear it said that her accomplishments were numerous was happily able to reflect that such complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind inasmuch as there were several things in which she excelled
had_702.wav	had at least the element of humility that it always needed to be supported by proof lord warburton not only spent the night at gardencourt but he was persuaded to remain over the second day and when the second day was ended
he_703.wav	he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow during this period he addressed many of his remarks to isabel who accepted this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace she found herself liking him extremely
the_704.wav	the first impression he had made on her had had weight but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce fell short of seeing him though quite without luridity as a hero of romance
with_705.wav	with a quickened consciousness of possible felicities it's very nice to know two such charming people as those she said meaning by those her cousin and her cousin's friend it must be added moreover
that_706.wav	that an incident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good humour to the test
but_707.wav	but his wife remained in the drawing room with the other members of the party she prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour and then rising observed to isabel that it was time they should bid the gentlemen good night isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed
the_708.wav	the occasion wore to her sense a festive character and feasts were not in the habit of terminating so early so without further thought she replied very simply need i go dear aunt i'll come up in half an hour
its_709.wav	it's impossible i should wait for you missus touchett answered
ralph_710.wav	ralph will light my candle isabel gaily engaged i'll light your candle do let me light your candle miss archer
only_711.wav	only i beg it shall not be before midnight
and_712.wav	and transferred them coldly to her niece
youre_713.wav	you're not you're not at your blest albany my dear isabel rose blushing i wish i were she said oh i say mother ralph broke out
i_714.wav	i must take it as i find it can't i stay with my own cousin isabel enquired i'm not aware that lord warburton is your cousin perhaps i had better go to bed the visitor suggested that will arrange it
missus_715.wav	missus touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again
ralph_716.wav	ralph meanwhile handed isabel her candlestick he had been watching her it had seemed to him her temper was involved an accident that might be interesting but if he had expected anything of a flare he was disappointed for the girl simply laughed a little
nodded_717.wav	nodded good night and withdrew accompanied by her aunt for himself he was annoyed at his mother though he thought she was right above stairs the two ladies separated at missus touchett's door isabel had said nothing on her way up
isabel_718.wav	isabel considered i'm not vexed but i'm surprised and a good deal mystified wasn't it proper i should remain in the drawing room not in the least young girls here in decent houses
dont_719.wav	don't sit alone with the gentlemen late at night you were very right to tell me then said isabel i don't understand it but i'm very glad to know it i shall always tell you her aunt answered whenever i see you taking what seems to me too much liberty
yes_720.wav	yes i think i'm very fond of them but i always want to know the things one shouldn't do so as to do them asked her aunt
and_721.wav	and a girl called bellah postik they were cousins and as their mothers were great friends and constantly in and out of each other's houses they had often been laid in the same cradle and had played and fought over their games when they are grown up they will marry said the mothers
and_722.wav	and soon they might have been heard bewailing to each other the hardness of their lots
i_723.wav	i would rent a bit of ground from the master and then we could be married yes answered bellah with a deep sigh but we live in such hard times and at the last fair the price of pigs had risen again we shall have long to wait
that_724.wav	that is quite clear replied houarn turning away to his work whenever they met they repeated their grievances and at length houarn's patience was exhausted and one morning he came to bellah and told her that he was going away to seek his fortune
the_725.wav	the girl was very unhappy as she listened to this and felt sorry that she had not tried to make the best of things she implored houarn not to leave her but he would listen to nothing the birds he said continue flying until they reach a field of corn and
like_726.wav	like them i shall seek till i get what i want that is money to buy a cow and a pig to fatten and if you love me bellah you won't attempt to hinder a plan which will hasten our marriage the girl saw it was useless to say more so she answered sadly
well_727.wav	well go then since you must but first i will divide with you all that my parents left me and going to her room she opened a small chest and took from it a bell a knife and a little stick this bell she said can be heard at any distance however far
but_728.wav	but it only rings to warn us that our friends are in great danger the knife frees all it touches from the spells that have been laid on them while the stick will carry you wherever you want to go i will give you the knife to guard you against the enchantments of wizards
and_729.wav	and the bell to tell me of your perils the stick i shall keep for myself so that i can fly to you if ever you have need of me then they cried for a little on each other's necks and houarn started for the mountains but in those days as in these beggars abounded
and_730.wav	and through every village he passed they followed houarn in crowds mistaking him for a gentleman because there were no holes in his clothes there is no fortune to be made here he thought to himself it is a place for spending and not earning i see i must go further
and_731.wav	and he walked on to pont aven a pretty little town built on the bank of a river he was sitting on a bench outside an inn
and_732.wav	and the men answered that it was the name given to the fairy that dwelt in the lake
and_733.wav	and besought him not to be so mad and to throw away his life in such a foolish manner but he only laughed
but_734.wav	but the men did not know how this was to be done and shaking their heads over his obstinacy left him to his fate
the_735.wav	the island was large and lying almost across it was a lake with a narrow opening to the sea houarn paid the boatman and sent him away and then proceeded to walk round the lake
as_736.wav	as soon as the young man had recovered from his surprise he prepared to jump into the lake and swim to shore but the bird had guessed his intentions and plunged beneath the water
the_737.wav	the pink and white of her face reminded you of the shells of her palace while her long black hair was intertwined with strings of coral and her dress of green silk seemed formed out of the sea at the sight of her houarn stopped dazzled by her beauty
my_738.wav	my name is houarn he answered
and_739.wav	and she beckoned him to follow her into a second hall whose floors and walls were formed of pearls while down the sides there were tables laden with fruit and wines of all kinds
came_740.wav	came from shipwrecked vessels and were brought to her palace by a magic current of water i do not wonder exclaimed houarn who now felt quite at home do not wonder that the people on the earth have so much to say about you the rich are always envied
the_741.wav	the young man gazed at her in surprise could any one so rich and so beautiful really wish to be his wife he looked at her again and bellah was forgotten as he answered a man would be mad indeed to refuse such an offer i can only accept it with joy
when_742.wav	when it was full she went into a large kitchen and threw them all into a golden pot
but_743.wav	but it did not sound the least like that to houarn there it is again he said after a short pause
jump_744.wav	jump she replied but soon the noise grew louder and like cries what is it asked houarn beginning to feel uncomfortable just the crickets on the hearth said she and broke into a song which drowned the cries from the pot
but_745.wav	but though houarn held his peace he was not as happy as before something seemed to have gone wrong and then he suddenly remembered bellah is it possible i can have forgotten her so soon
and_746.wav	and four men stood before him houarn save us we entreat you and save yourself too murmured they not daring to raise their voices
and_747.wav	and no sooner was the ceremony over than she turned us into fishes as she had done to all our forerunners who are in the fish pond still where you will shortly join them
it_748.wav	it was at this very moment that bellah who was skimming the milk in the farm dairy heard the fairy bell tinkle violently at the sound she grew pale for she knew it meant that houarn was in danger
little_749.wav	little staff of apple tree over the earth and over the sea up in the air be guide to me everywhere to wander free and immediately the stick became a smart little horse with a rosette at each ear and a feather on his forehead he stood quite still
the_750.wav	the swallow is less swift than the wind the wind is less swift than the lightning but you my horse if you love me must be swifter than them all for there is a part of my heart that suffers the best part of my heart that is in danger and the horse heard her
and_751.wav	and galloped like a straw carried along by a tempest till they reached the foot of a rock called the leap of the deer
to_752.wav	to save you repeated bellah but who are you my little friend
and_753.wav	and it is owing to her that i am here but what are you doing in this nest i am sitting on six eggs of stone and i shall not be set free till they are hatched
when_754.wav	when you have found her you must contrive to get hold of the net of steel that hangs from her waist and shut her up in it for ever but where am i to find a young man's clothes asked she i will show you he replied
and_755.wav	and the fourth an iron without waiting for orders they sat down in the nest and crossing their legs comfortably began to prepare the suit of clothes for bellah with one of the leaves of the cabbage they made her a coat
and_756.wav	and with it in her hand she stepped into the blue boat which conducted her to the palace of shells the groac'h seemed overjoyed to see her and told her that never before had she beheld such a handsome young man
very_757.wav	very soon she led her visitor into the great hall where wine and fruit were always waiting and on the table lay the magic knife left there by houarn
and_758.wav	and to the pond which contained the fish their sides shining with a thousand different colours
and_759.wav	and turning rapidly flung it over the witch's head become in body what you are in soul cried she and in an instant the lovely fairy of the sea was a toad horrible to look upon she struggled hard to tear the net asunder but it was no use
her_760.wav	her eyes fell on a green frog on his knees beside her his little paws crossed over his little heart bellah felt as if fingers were tightening round her throat but she managed to cry is this you my houarn is this you it is i croaked the little frog
in_761.wav	in a car drawn by six cockchafers which once had been the six stone eggs here i am he exclaimed you have broken the spell that held me and now come and get your reward and dismounting from his chariot he led them down into the caves filled with gold and jewels
and_762.wav	and shoes with silver buckles the women were all filled with envy but little cared barbaik what they might whisper behind her back as long as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone else's and that she had more partners than any other girl
and_763.wav	and what was worse often made fun of him with the rest
one_764.wav	one evening he was bringing back his horses from the fields and stopped at a little lake on the way home to let them drink he was tired with a long day's work and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the animals waiting till they had done and thinking all the while of barbaik
when_765.wav	when a voice came out of the gorse close by
it_766.wav	it is i the brownie of the lake replied the voice but where are you inquired jegu look close and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little green frog i can take he added proudly any shape i choose
and_767.wav	and even which is much harder be invisible if i want to then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally appear replied jegu certainly if you wish and the frog jumped on the back of one of the horses and changed into a little dwarf all dressed in green
at_768.wav	at first under different animal shapes since that time partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves we have continued to transform ourselves and it was in this way that i got to know you how exclaimed jegu filled with astonishment
but_769.wav	but how are you going to do it exclaimed jegu wonderingly that is my affair perhaps i may tell you later meanwhile you just eat and sleep and don't worry yourself about anything
jegu_770.wav	jegu declared that nothing could be easier and then taking off his hat he thanked the dwarf heartily and led his horses back to the farm next morning was a holiday and barbaik was awake earlier than usual
as_771.wav	as she wished to get through her work as soon as possible and be ready to start for a dance which was to be held some distance off she went first to the cow house which it was her duty to keep clean but to her amazement she found fresh straw put down
the_772.wav	the racks filled with hay the cows milked and the pails standing neatly in a row
and_773.wav	and when she met him outside the door she stopped and thanked him for his help to be sure jegu only replied roughly that he didn't know what she was talking about but this answer made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else
indeed_774.wav	indeed barbaik had only to express a wish for it to be satisfied if the wind was cold or the sun was hot and she was afraid to go out lest her complexion should be spoilt she need only to run down to the spring close by and say softly i should like my churns to be full
and_775.wav	and my wet linen to be stretched on the hedge to dry and she need never give another thought to the matter if she found the rye bread too hard to bake or the oven taking too long to heat she just murmured i should like to see my six loaves on the shelf above the bread box
why_776.wav	why am i not already back from morlaix with my milk pot empty my butter bowl inside it a pound of wild cherries on my wooden plate and the money i have gained in my apron pocket and in the morning when she got up lo and behold
and_777.wav	and six new pieces of silver in the pocket of her apron and she believed that all this was owing to jegu and she could no longer do without him even in her thoughts when things had reached this pass the brownie told the young man that he had better ask barbaik to marry him
and_778.wav	and this time the girl did not turn rudely away but listened patiently to the end
and_779.wav	and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time just like a young lady and as for the rest of the day
she_780.wav	she would wear the beautiful dresses that came when she wished for them
barbaik_781.wav	barbaik was furious
her_782.wav	her heart was filled with rage against the brownie who had caused her to expect a life of ease and pleasure but when she looked at jegu and beheld his red face squinting eyes and untidy hair her anger was doubled
while_783.wav	while now i can receive no presents except from my husband i can never dance except with my husband oh you wretched dwarf i will never never forgive you in spite of her fierce words no one knew better than barbaik how to put her pride in her pocket when it suited her
and_784.wav	and after receiving an invitation to a wedding she begged the brownie to get her a horse to ride there to her great joy he consented bidding her set out for the city of the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted
she_785.wav	she had hardly spoken when the horse appeared and mounting on his back she started for the village where the wedding was to be held at first she was so delighted with the chance of a holiday from the work which she hated that she noticed nothing
but_786.wav	but very soon it struck her as odd that as she passed along the roads full of people they all laughed as they looked at her horse at length she caught some words uttered by one man to another why the farmer's wife has sold her horse's tail and turned in her saddle
but_787.wav	but it was of no use he declined to move out of a walk
so_788.wav	so one day the brownie asked jegu if he might bring his friends to have supper in the great barn and whether he would allow them to dance there of course jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything for the brownie and he ordered barbaik to spread her best table cloths in the barn
when_789.wav	when all was ready the dwarfs in new green suits came bustling in very happy and merry and took their seats at the table but in a moment they all sprang up with a cry and ran away screaming for barbaik had placed pans of hot coals under their feet and all their poor little toes were burnt
you_790.wav	you won't forget that in a hurry she said smiling grimly to herself but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water which they poured on the fire then they joined hands and danced round it singing wicked traitress
the_791.wav	the wedding shuts one gate and opens another the longings and dreamings of courtship are at an end the supreme intimacy of life begins as john and mary move away from the altar pronounced man and wife they know they are starting a great adventure
his_792.wav	his beaming face masks a stiff determination to keep his bride happy in spite of any worldly obstacles her radiance hides a solemn inward vow to do everything humanly possible to make smooth the way of their life together they are right
unless_793.wav	unless they are very different from most people this new joint enterprise is going to mean more to each of them than anything else ever can before them is a clear road not to happiness as they may believe but to the opportunity for gaining happiness
when_794.wav	when one has received the promise of something greatly desired but must wait awhile before its delivery the happiness of the waiting period is characterized by the absence of a critical spirit and therefore is apt to be thought of as an experience of pure delight
but_795.wav	but the first days of marriage bring out a different set of feelings those that come when one has definitely obtained possession of anything that before was only promised at first the emotions seem to stand still this is the long coveted moment then one begins to appraise
is_796.wav	is the object of one's wishes as desirable as one had expected because reality rarely measures up to imagination the first answer is almost bound to be no this is not what i expected and the first emotion tends to be disappointment
regardless_797.wav	regardless of hazy but optimistic expectations and the object possessed will more than likely turn out to be better than although different from what the imagination pictured knowing that a fleeting sense of disappointment is not peculiar to one's own marriage but likely to occur in all
roughly_798.wav	roughly both the helps and the hindrances to married happiness can be lumped under one word personalities temperament mannerisms tastes all that is implied in the distinct individuality of each person make up the chief source of the advantages
and_799.wav	and disadvantages with which the couple enter marriage these traits cannot be changed overnight nor is it necessary or at all wise that they should be john attracts mary and she appeals to him because the personality of each one is what it is
love_800.wav	love has grown up between the two as a result of this personality attraction and love is the motive that will make both try to keep open the pathway to marriage success but love is not a finished product that once it comes can forever after be trusted to keep its strength
like_801.wav	like everything else that is alive it must be kept growing through exercise or it wastes away love gives the push that keeps a marriage moving but it does not give the direction that comes from understanding and cooperation
this_802.wav	this is what they must guard against while love is still the moving force of their lives they must study the problems that are due to come to wait until they are beset by them is to beg for trouble
in_803.wav	in order to cope with their problems they must realize first that they cannot stumble upon married happiness that they must possess and cultivate a positive will to succeed
here_804.wav	here are nine guideposts to help john and mary along their road one the first requirement is the building of a union that is just to both the smaller issues on which this rests are the lively clashes of opposite desires
inevitable_805.wav	inevitable in the coming together of any two persons intensified when those two persons are as different as a man and a woman and unavoidable for two committed to a lifetime together in the close quarters of marriage two
compromise_806.wav	compromise will lift these essentially petty decisions of precedence above the level of selfishness decisions must be made on the basis of what is good for both not the selfish or narrow wish of either
the_807.wav	the choice that brings the larger advantage to the two persons in their common role of marriage partners is the one to be made human judgment being as faulty as it is
in_808.wav	in either situation the particular couple involved have to weigh delicately the effect on their joint enterprise of the conflicting courses of action much as mary may crave a child or a car
if_809.wav	if each one is hurt at the other's inability to join instantly in his or her plans they will need to take pains not to get sidetracked into making a personal contest of the affair trying to win over your partner with a single eye to getting what you want
regardless_810.wav	regardless of its effect on the mate is short sighted in the extreme even if you could care only for personal pleasure that cannot long outlast your spouse's displeasure staging a contest or a succession of small contests for the sake of finding out who is boss
builds_811.wav	builds up a habit of fighting that may lead to a bitter end it is useless to discover who can win in any particular skirmish what is important is to learn whether one of you is set on being head of the house if your spouse craves that distinction by all means hand it over without delay
it_812.wav	it is an empty honor for the one who bends but does not break will readily develop the fine art of influencing the headstrong one because it is part of the traditional feminine character to enjoy giving in to the man this tendency must be scrutinized when it appears
no_813.wav	no man can afford to be crippled for life by letting his wife swaddle him with solicitude as some mothers spoil their children for their own glorification a woman's feeling that she will be emotionally gratified by making a sacrifice does not prove that aside from her momentary pleasure
any_814.wav	any individual woman may waver between a craving for self sacrifice and a repugnance to the very thought of it this changeableness can make her feel resentful after she has given in to her husband all this must be taken into account in making decisions
compromise_815.wav	compromise not submission should be the rule if john forges ahead on one count mary must find an acceptable outlet for herself on some other front three
and_816.wav	and the effort to do so to please the partner is liable to result in a topheavy hypocrisy a superstructure calculated to impress the observer but built on a shaky foundation of chaos
a_817.wav	a chameleon changes color easily to match its environment or temper of the moment but a human being's more lasting change is not so readily made each marriage partner must be proud of the other and let the other continue to be proud of him or her
therefore_818.wav	therefore you have to respect yourself and act as if you did even at home too many couples exploit the sense of let down that marriage brings with it after so long a time husband and wife cease to feel that they must exert themselves for each other in little matters
knowing_819.wav	knowing themselves accepted they lounge mentally mannerly and physically when at home or elsewhere alone together some of this relaxation is a good thing but it is a mistake to let home and spouse degenerate into nothing more than an invitation to be lazy
using_820.wav	using the mate for relief as in nagging whining crying or grumbling is taboo if you are tired or irritable you can rest or exercise for restoration as in the days before marriage
and_821.wav	and dry up the source of refreshment you are trying to tap fatigue and nervousness expressed breed fatigue and nervousness in a sympathetic audience four too great concentration is to be avoided
even_822.wav	even the greatest love stagnates if it is kept out of the main current of life to care only for each other is selfishness for two only one step removed from self centered engrossment
this_823.wav	this is why the unique value of children is their service as an entering wedge in the close grown love of husband and wife a wedge that widens and holds forever wider the unity of love it has penetrated other responsibilities other interests may serve a similar purpose
though_824.wav	though more easily dislodged and seldom striking so deep friends old and new have a function in relieving the overclose concern of one marriage partner with the other if they are to play their full part in preventing overconcentration
common_825.wav	common friends are fine but for this purpose there is special need of friends for either spouse who can call forth those sides of his or her nature that are not aroused by the mate
the_826.wav	the factor that underlies all the perplexities and most of the contentment of marriage is its unique degree of concentrated intimacy here the supreme testing always comes each means so much to the other
the_827.wav	the wife may be alone part of the day and profit by it when john comes home at night he has not had that privilege
or_828.wav	or by going out without his wife or by having his friends in when she is not around five the general level of emotion is what counts not the spectacular scaling of peaks staking all on high moments is melodrama with no comic relief
some_829.wav	some husbands some wives are artists at achieving and momentarily living up to romantic settings but quickly flop down to the lower levels of decent fairness between the high spots of their sentimental flare ups others cannot utter a poetic phrase
make_830.wav	make a romantic gesture or let their eyes show the quick intensity of their tender emotions if they must die for it this difference is one of make up and training not of marriage capacity the couple who are sure of each other's steady affection regardless of its expression in romantic interludes
another_831.wav	another terrible moment that is due to come may seem even more frightening because it is you who are slipping soon or late you find that some familiar mannerism of your spouse displeases you it may be a slight uncouthness at table
now_832.wav	now it vexes you and your vexation terrifies you does this mean that you no longer love your mate as you did you cannot help your change of feeling how then can you hope to keep your affection from disappearing altogether if it has already begun to wane
you_833.wav	you remember other people you once thought you loved and wonder panic stricken how you can keep this love from dying as those other loves did this is probably an almost universal experience marking not the beginning of the end of love
maturity_834.wav	maturity brings recognition of human imperfections in the most heroic but also develops the ability to weigh big and little things and to
always_835.wav	always it is the unturned page the holds the answer to the question how goes it with this marriage the present is useful only as a foundation stone for the future which is being built up out of many fleeting present moments each quickly lost in the past
seven_836.wav	seven there can be no narrowing of marriage to mere sex adjustment
and_837.wav	and the two persons have to work out a common life that means something to them over and above the pleasure they may take in each other's company as a continuing part of this life adjustment sex adjustment can develop into a permanent factor of married happiness
but_838.wav	but without the larger adjustment the partial adjustment cannot be made in any fundamental and enduring form in the sex life in marriage as in other parts of the association each partner wins by considering the other before the self
but_839.wav	but instead a complete trust in each other one who prides himself or herself on having to be handled with gloves has a great deal of growing up to do in order to be able to be an active partner in the marriage cry babying is no more helpful in marriage than in business or social life
in_840.wav	in the healthy marriage this sympathetic response will soon give way to anger which in turn may have the effect of a dash of cold water in the face of the oversensitive one helping him or her to buck up and behave like an adult in the unhealthy marriage sympathy will grow into pity
the_841.wav	the marriage partner who is mature will maintain trust in the other's good intentions in the face of what might seem to be occasions for hurt feelings a chief advantage of the married estate is its opportunity for frankness why doesn't his wife tell him of that unpleasant mannerism so he can correct it
mary_842.wav	mary may soon lose courage and relinquish her wifely job of husband improvement or the combination may be reversed frankness must go clothed in tact stiff minded people who are frank only when angry lose their case before they present it
if_843.wav	if the expression of anger is to have its proper stimulative effect it has to be administered but rarely and then in small doses more has a paralyzing effect on the recipient
producing_844.wav	producing a response in kind that takes away the ability to think of anything except retaliation nine willingness to grow is the most necessary factor for success marriage is a life program of going on together that requires maturity
as_845.wav	as this is an impossibility they are aware of increasing dissatisfaction that does not mean they are unadapted to each other they are afraid to leave the known pleasures of their first youth for the unguessed satisfactions of maturity so they try to stand still

nothing_876.wav	nothing further could be done in the way of searching for the latter personage until daylight it was getting on pretty well towards morning when missus savareen sought her couch and when she got there her slumber was broken and disturbed she knew not what to think
but_877.wav	but she was haunted by a dread that she would never again see her husband alive next morning soon after daylight the whole neighborhood was astir and the country round was carefully searched for any trace of the missing man
squire_878.wav	squire harrington went down to town and made inquiries at the bank where he ascertained that the story told by savareen to old jonathan perry
was_879.wav	was substantially correct this effectually disposed of any possible theory as to jonathan and his wife having mistaken somebody else for savareen squire harrington likewise learned all about the man's doings on the previous afternoon

perry_881.wav	perry professed to have seen and conversed with him there was no longer any room for doubt that interview and conversation had actually taken place at eight o'clock on the previous evening and savareen had ridden northward from the gate within five minutes afterwards he could not have proceeded more than a hundred
or_882.wav	or at the very outside two hundred yards further or he must inevitably have been encountered by lapierre
but_883.wav	but the horse which had disappeared in this unaccountable manner it seemed improbable that two living substances of such bulk should pass out of being and leave no trace behind them they must literally have melted into thin air no they hadn't at least the black mare hadn't
for_884.wav	for she was discovered by several members of the searching party a little before noon when found she was quietly cropping the damp herbage at the edge of the cranberry swamp at the rear of squire harrington's farm she was wholly uninjured and had evidently spent the night there
the_885.wav	the bit had been removed from her mouth but the bridle hung intact round her neck the saddle however like its owner had disappeared from her back then the men began a systematic search in the interior of the swamp they soon came upon the saddle which had apparently been deliberately unbuckled
and_886.wav	and deposited on a dry patch of ground near the edge of the morass a little further in the interior they came upon a man's coat made of dark brown stuff
as_887.wav	as belong to savareen it was wet and besmirched with mud and in fact was lying half in and half out of a little puddle of water when it was found then the searchers made sure of finding the body but in this they were disappointed
but_888.wav	but found nothing further to reward their search the ground was too soft and marshy to retain any traces of footsteps and the mare and saddle furnished the only evidence that the object of their quest had been in the neighborhood of the swamp and of course this evidence was of the most vague and inconclusive character
then_889.wav	then the party proceeded in a body to the missing man's house here another surprise awaited them the coat was at once recognised by missus savareen as belonging to her husband but it was not the coat worn by him at the time of his disappearance of this there was no doubt whatever

all_899.wav	all that remained was to learn how he had accomplished the apparent miracles
the_900.wav	the woman at the lake and in the courtyard the movement of the body and the vanishing of the evidence under his hand paredes's odd behaviour all became in his mind puzzling details that failed to obscure the chief fact
after_901.wav	after this something must be done about paredes's detention he hadn't dreamed that his weariness could placate even momentarily such reflections but at last he slept again
he_902.wav	he was aroused by the tramping of men around the house and strange harsh voices he raised himself on his elbow and glanced from the window it had long been daylight two burly fellows in overalls carrying pick and spade across their shoulders
pushed_903.wav	pushed through the underbrush at the edge of the clearing he turned graham fully dressed stood at the side of the bed those men bobby asked wearily the grave diggers graham answered they are going to work in the old cemetery to prepare a place for silas blackburn

he_913.wav	he strolled over and handed bobby a number of newspapers where's robinson bobby asked i saw him in the court a while ago i daresay he's wandering around perhaps watching the men at the grave he learned nothing new last night i was with him at breakfast i gather not
bobby_914.wav	bobby looked up isn't that an automobile coming through the woods he asked maybe rawlins back from smithtown or the minister the car stopped at the entrance of the court they heard the remote tinkling of the front door bell jenkins passed through
his_915.wav	his sharp exclamation recalled howells's report which at their direction he had failed to mail had his exclamation been drawn by an accuser bobby started to rise graham moved toward the door then jenkins entered and stood to one side

pay_923.wav	pay him will you jenkins thanks

compelled_925.wav	compelled him to remain for the present in the mournful tragic house therefore he would crush his justifiable anger
and_926.wav	and he had asked for money only a trifling sum yet graham would grasp at the fact to support his earlier suspicion paredes's arrival possessed one virtue it diverted bobby's thoughts temporarily from his own dilemma from his inability to chart a course
graham_927.wav	graham on the other hand was ill at ease
for_928.wav	for him yesterday's incident was not so lightly to be passed over eventually his curiosity conquered the words came nevertheless with some difficulty
we_929.wav	we took it for granted you would find it necessary to stay in smithtown for a while
simple_930.wav	simple enough mister graham i telephoned as soon as rawlins got me to the bastille i communicated with the lawyer who represents the company for which i once worked he's a prominent and brilliant man he planned it with some local fellow when i was arraigned at the opening of court this morning
the_931.wav	the judge could hold me only as a material witness he fixed a pretty stiff bail but the local lawyer was there with a bondsman and i came back my clothes are here you don't mind bobby that moment in the hall when graham had awakened him urged bobby to reply with a genuine warmth
i_932.wav	i don't mind i'm glad you're out of it
your_933.wav	your presence in the private staircase was the last straw you will forgive us carlos
he_934.wav	he smoked with a vast contentment that's better nothing to forgive bobby let us call it a misunderstanding graham moved closer
his_935.wav	his eyes still smiled but his voice was harder bygones are bygones isn't that so bobby since you wish it bobby said but more important than the knowledge graham desired loomed the old question what was the man's game what held him here
robinson_936.wav	robinson entered the flesh around his eyes was puffier than it had been yesterday worry had increased the incongruous discontent of his round face clearly he had slept little i saw you arrive he said rawlins warned me
but_937.wav	but i must say i didn't think you'd use your freedom to come to us
since_938.wav	since the law won't hold me at your convenience in smithtown i keep myself at your service here if bobby permits it could you ask more bobby shrank from the man with whom he had idled away so much time and money
that_939.wav	that fleeting satanic impression of yesterday came back sharper more alarming paredes's clear challenge to the district attorney was the measure of his strength his mind was subtler than theirs
his_940.wav	his reserve and easy daring mastered them all and always as now he laughed at the futility of their efforts to sound his purposes to limit his freedom of action bobby didn't care to meet the uncommunicative eyes whose depths he had never been able to explore
that_941.wav	that might make men walk unconsciously to accomplish the ends of an unscrupulous brain the district attorney appeared as much at sea as the others
and_942.wav	and glancing at bobby he asked with a hollow scorn you've no objection to the gentleman visiting you for the present if he wishes bobby answered
robinson_943.wav	robinson jerked his head toward the window i've been watching the preparations out there
no_944.wav	no hurry bobby answered with a quick intake of breath i suppose not robinson sneered since everybody knows well enough what's in it bobby arose robinson still sneered you'll be at the grave as chief mourner
bobby_945.wav	bobby walked from the room he hadn't cared to reply he feared as it was that he had let slip his increased self doubt he put on his coat and hat and left the house the raw cold the year's first omen of winter made his blood run quicker
forced_946.wav	forced into his mind a cleansing stimulation but almost immediately even that prophylactic was denied him with his direction a matter of indifference chance led him into the thicket at the side of the house he had walked some distance
the_947.wav	the underbrush had long interposed a veil between him and the cedars above whose roofs smoke wreathed in the still air like fantastic figures weaving a shroud to lower over the time stained melancholy walls
for_948.wav	for once he was grateful to the forest because it had forbidden him to glance perpetually back at that dismal and pensive picture then he became aware of twigs hastily lopped off of bushes bent and torn of the uncovering through these careless means of an old path
the_949.wav	the dull thud of earth falling regularly he paused listening the labour of the men was given an uncouth rhythm by their grunting expulsions of breath otherwise the nature of their industry and its surroundings had imposed upon them a silence
in_950.wav	in itself beast like and unnatural at last a harsh voice came to bobby its brevity pointed the previous dumbness of the speaker deep enough and bobby turned and hurried back along the roughly restored path
as_951.wav	as if fleeing from an immaterial thing suddenly quickened with the power of accusation he could picture the fresh oblong excavation in the soil of the family burial ground
there_952.wav	there was an ironical justice in the condition of the old cemetery it had received no interment since the death of katherine's father like everything about the cedars silas blackburn had delivered it to the swift obliterating fingers of time
if_953.wav	if the old man in his selfishness had paused to gaze beyond the inevitable fact of death
he_954.wav	he would have guarded with a more precious interest the drapings of his final sleep this necessary task on which bobby had stumbled had made the thicket less congenial than the house as he walked back he forecasted with a keen apprehension his approaching ordeal
could_955.wav	could he witness the definite imprisonment of his grandfather in a narrow box could he watch the covering earth fall noisily in that bleak place of silence without displaying for robinson
a_956.wav	a strange man appeared walking from the direction of the house his black clothing relieved only by narrow edges of white cuffs between the sleeves and the heavy mourning gloves fitted with solemn harmony into the landscape and bobby's mood
such_957.wav	such a figure was appropriate to the cedars
he_958.wav	he emerged from the forest and saw again the leisurely weaving of the smoke shroud above the house then his eyes were drawn by the restless movements of a pair of horses
no_959.wav	no likely path yet whose crossing is the price of salvation he was glad to see graham leave the court and hurry toward him i was coming to hunt you up bobby the minister's arrived so has doctor groom everything's about ready doctor groom
its_960.wav	it's natural enough he should be here bobby agreed indifferently they walked slowly back to the house graham made it plain that his mind was far from the sad business ahead
he_961.wav	he asked he ignores what happened yesterday he settles himself in the cedars again i don't know what to think of it bobby answered this morning carlos gave me the creeps
